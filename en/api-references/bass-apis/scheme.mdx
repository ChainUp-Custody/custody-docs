## Overview

In order to allow public chain developers to access the Keysecure more conveniently and quickly, we provide BaaS services to meet the public chain docking needs. Based on the docking experience of past customers, the platform has sorted out a set of docking solutions. details as follows:

The whole Process is divided into three stepsï¼š

1. Register A Deposit Address

2. Make Deposits

3. Make Withdrawals

The overall docking process is as follows

## Register Deposit Address

1. The number of available addresses can be queried by coin name. Note: (A maximum of `100addresses` per push to system, with each push checking that the number of addresses remaining available toKeysecure is greater than 5,000 and disallowing registration if 5,000 addresses are not being used. Interface address: ``/api/v1/address/available`)

2. Push the coin name and address list to the BaaS platform, after the response is successful, and the representative registered address is successful (interface address: `/api/v1/address/register`)

Note: If the type of registered coin is memo, the same address Only one registration is allowed.

## Deposits

1. The third-party detects that the address has a deposit transaction, initiates a deposit notification, and informs the BaaS system (interface address: `/api/v1/deposit/notify`)

2. BaaS returns the notification result

## Withdrawals

1. The user initiates a withdrawal request in the Keysecure System

2. Main chain developers pull the list of withdrawals (**interface address**: `/api/v1/withdraw/consume`)

3. After the chain is successfully connected, BaaS will be notified of the withdrawal result, and the BaaS interface will respond (**interface address**: `/api/v1/withdraw/notify`)

Note: In case of special circumstances, the withdrawal request can be withdrawn and a notification will be pushed to the BaaS interface (**interface address**: `/api/v1/withdraw/cancel`)
