## Create a Workspace

After logging in, create a MPC System for your team in the app. The workspace creation will generate one private key share locally in the app. It is crucial to promptly back up the private key share, as some functions will be unavailable without it.

Currently, there are two backup methods: `Manual Copy` and `Upload to Cloud Server`.

MPC System include both a **Workspace** and **Wallets**.

<Tip>
A Workspace can create multiple wallets.
</Tip>


### Use Cases

* The Workspace can be used for asset statistics for a specific business line, while wallets are assigned to different users.

* The Workspace can be used for overall company asset statistics, with wallets assigned to different business departments.

<Warning>
The **Private Key** Password is used for **encrypting and decrypting private key shares** and is crucial for your asset security. Please ensure **timely backup**. The backup methods and password are essential for the secure use of the MPC System.
</Warning>

* ChainUp Custody uses a **3-3 signature strategy**, with two private key shares encrypted and stored on Microsoft and Amazon cloud services, and one private key share **stored locally** on the user's device.

* Users have **100% control over their assets**: ChainUp Custody only assists users in managing assets and cannot access user assets without the user's private key share signature. Therefore, users need to promptly back up and securely store the **local private key share**.

* For user convenience, the private key share exists in the form of a **recovery phrases**.

If the workspace configuration does not meet your requirements, please contact your dedicated **Business Manager** or **email** to custody@chainup.com for support.
