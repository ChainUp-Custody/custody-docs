**Keysecure** ensures the overall implementation and application of **MPC** technology, providing the highest level of market security for your investment assets. User private keys are jointly managed by users and Keysecure, granting you complete control over your assets without limitations of time and location. This technology facilitates easy backup and recovery of assets, eliminating single-point failures in private key management and enhancing the security of self-managed assets.

The nature of the **MPC** protocol allows users to know which private key shares participate in signing without requiring participants to disclose their identities externally. This ensures the confidentiality of each party's input. Additionally, MPC guarantees that the signature generation party remains private and invisible on the network, ensuring personal data privacy while maintaining the trustworthiness of multi-party cooperation and transactions.


Developers can quickly integrate the Keysecure - MPC System API according to the following process.
