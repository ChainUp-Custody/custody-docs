title: Integration Testing

To facilitate clients in quickly and conveniently integrating the system, Keysecure  has outlined the core processes based on past client integration experiences, focusing on the integration solutions for [**Get Receiving(Deposit) Address**] , [**User Receiving(Deposit)**] and [**User Transfer (Withdrawal)**]. The details are as follows:

## Get Receiving Address

- Create a wallet `/api/mpc/sub_wallet/create`

- Create a coin address for the wallet `/api/mpc/sub_wallet/create/address`

- Keysecure  callbacks Co-Signer for signing, and Co-Signer collaborates with Keysecure  node to complete the signing

- Successfully signed, return the address created for the coin

<Warning>
Addresses support two types: system addresses and user addresses. The `system address` is used for auto sweep or is used as change address, cannot be assigned to users.
</Warning>

## User Receiving (Deposit)
- Users complete registration within the client system.

- When users view the coin receiving address in the frontend, the client system assigns a coin address to the user.

- Users deposits assets to the assigned address.

- Keysecure  monitors the blockchain address for incoming transactions. After detecting a deposit, Keysecure  notifies the client's business system of the receiving notification (the client's system actively retrieves `/api/mpc/billing/sync_deposit_list`).

- The client obtains the current block height of the corresponding blockchain for the coin (`/api/mpc/chain_height`).

- The client system credits the user's account after confirming the required number of secure confirmations.

- User receives the coin (deposits successful).

## User Transfer (Withdrawal)

- Users initiate a transfer in the client system.

- After the client system approves the Transfer, it initiates a Transfer request to the Keysecure  system via API `/api/mpc/billing/withdraw`.

- Co-Signer periodically retrieves withdrawal transactions. If Co-Signer has configured a callback program, it confirms with the client's business system. If Co-Signer has configured signature verification, it verifies the signature and collaborates with the Keysecure  node to sign.

- Once signed, Keysecure  broadcasts the transaction to the blockchain and monitors its status.

<Tip>
Supported blockchains for acceleration can be obtained through the API `/api/mpc/wallet/open_coin`.
</Tip>

- After blockchain confirmation, Keysecure  notifies the client's business system of the transfer notification (the client's system actively retrieves `/api/mpc/billing/sync_withdraw_list`).

- The client system updates the order status.

- User transfer out successful.
