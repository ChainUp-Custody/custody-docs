Co-Signer can help you quickly integrate with the API and needs to be deployed separately on a server. Co-Signer needs to bind the shard private key of your wallet for `creating addresses` and `signing transactions`.


- Before signing a transaction, Co-Signer will callback to your business system. It can initiate the signature only after authorization is obtained; otherwise, the transaction cannot proceed.

- After the app-side signature authorization for the consolidation transaction, it will not callback to the Client system.

<Tip>
Both callback and signature sign verification methods can coexist, but **at least one verification method is required**. Developers can choose the verification method according to their needs.
