## Create a Wallet

After logging in, create a MPC wallet for your team in the app. The wallet creation will generate one private key share locally in the app. It is crucial to promptly back up the private key share, as some functions will be unavailable without it.

Currently, there are two backup methods: `Manual Copy` and `Upload to Cloud Server`.

Wallets include both a **Main Wallet** and **Sub Wallets**.

<Tip>
A main wallet can create multiple sub-wallets.
</Tip>


### Use Cases

* The main wallet can be used for asset statistics for a specific business line, while sub-wallets are assigned to different users.ã€‚

* The main wallet can be used for overall company asset statistics, with sub-wallets assigned to different business departments.

<Warning>
The **Private Key** Password is used for **encrypting and decrypting private key shares** and is crucial for your asset security. Please ensure **timely backup**. The backup methods and password are essential for the secure use of the MPC wallet.
</Warning>

* ChainUp Custody uses a **3-3 signature strategy**, with two private key shares encrypted and stored on Microsoft and Amazon cloud services, and one private key share **stored locally** on the user's device.

* Users have **100% control over their assets**: ChainUp Custody only assists users in managing assets and cannot access user assets without the user's private key share signature. Therefore, users need to promptly back up and securely store the **local private key share**.

* For user convenience, the private key share exists in the form of a **recovery phrases**.

If the wallet configuration does not meet your requirements, please contact your dedicated **Business Manager** or **email** to custody@chainup.com for support.
