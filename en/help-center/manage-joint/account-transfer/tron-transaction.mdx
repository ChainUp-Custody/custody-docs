title: TRON Transaction Mechanism
---

## Introduction
The TRON Network employs a unique fee model, differing from blockchains like Ethereum. Instead of using a fixed gas fee, it completes transactions through two resources: bandwidth and energy.
* Transferring TRX or TRC-10 tokens consumes bandwidth.
* Transferring TRC-20 tokens or executing contracts consumes both bandwidth and energy.
Users need to obtain these resources by directly burning TRX to meet the transaction requirements of the Tron network.

## Unique Mechanism
Directly burning TRX to pay for miner fees incurs high costs. To help customers reduce transaction fees and lower operational expenses, the Custody system has introduced an automatic delegation feature. For full custody users, the wallets they manage will by default use TRON transaction resources provided by the system. Users do not need to burn TRX; they only need to pay a small service fee to complete transactions.

## Scope of Application
The Custody platform provides resource delegation for TRON transactions on all wallets (enterprise wallets and cloud wallets). Users do not need to burn TRX as gas fees.

<Note>
**For Inactive Address**

In the TRON network, an address that has received TRX is considered an active address and supports the use of delegated resources. If an address is not yet activated, the first transaction must consume TRX to pay the miner's fee. To optimize the experience, the Custody system will automatically provide TRX for inactive addresses to complete activation. Subsequently, all transactions from that address will enjoy resource delegation services, reducing transaction costs.

## Billing Rules
### **Using Delegated Resources** 

The system will calculate the corresponding TRX value based on the actual resources consumed by the transaction, multiply it by **a certain percentage**, and charge it as the withdrawal miner fee for that transaction. This fee will be collected by Custody.

**Withdrawal Miner Fee = [Energy consumed by the transaction * Energy price + Bandwidth consumed by the transaction * Bandwidth price] * Custody service fee rate**

Energy price: 1 Energy = 0.00021 TRX

Bandwidth price: 1 Bandwidth = 0.001 TRX

<Note> 
The prices of energy and bandwidth are set by the TRON network.
</Note>

Custody service rate: A dynamic percentage, always less than 100%, which will be adjusted periodically based on actual conditions.

For example, if the user transfers USDT and consumes 65,000 energy and 300 bandwidth:

Resource consumption value of the transaction:

Energy consumption: 65,000 Energy × 0.00021 = 13.65 TRX

Bandwidth consumption: 300 Bandwidth × 0.001 = 0.3 TRX

**Total resource consumption value** = 13.65 + 0.3 = 13.95 TRX

Custody service rate: 80%, meaning Custody will only charge 80% of the transaction's resource cost.

**Withdrawal Miner Fee** = 13.95 × 80% = 11.16 TRX, which is lower than directly burning TRX to pay for miner fees, resulting in reduced transaction costs.



### **Not Using Delegated Resources**

If the transaction is not covered by delegated resources, the system will default to consuming TRX from the user's account as the withdrawal miner's fee, and the on-chain displayed miner's fee will be equivalent to the withdrawal miner's fee.
