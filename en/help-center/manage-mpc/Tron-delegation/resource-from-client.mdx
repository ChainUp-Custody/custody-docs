title: TRON Resource Delegation：Use Your Energy
---
  
## Introduction
The TRON blockchain employs a unique fee model, different from blockchains like Ethereum. It does not use a fixed Gas fee but instead utilizes two resources—bandwidth and energy—for transactions.
- Transferring TRX and TRC-10 tokens consumes bandwidth.
- Transferring TRC-20 tokens or executing contracts consumes both bandwidth and energy.
  

Burning TRX directly to pay for miner fees can be costly. To help clients save on transaction fees and reduce operational costs, Keysecure offers a unique solution **if you have sufficient resources** obtained through staking TRX. Simply provide a resource address, and the system will automatically monitor MPC workstation transactions, intelligently delegating resources to the relevant addresses. This significantly reduces operational costs while ensuring efficient and smooth transaction execution.
  
  
**One-Stop Operation:** As long as the provided address has sufficient resources, Keysecure will automatically allocate these resources to every TRON transaction within the workstation. No additional TRX will be consumed, making the entire transaction process simple and efficient. This significantly reduces operational complexity, allowing you to focus on business development while effortlessly achieving efficient transactions.

  This solution is only available to MPC Keysecure soultion.

## Frequently Asked Questions
  
 <Accordion title="How to understand the actual transaction resources consumed by an order?">
You can visit the blockchain explorer and query the transaction’s TXID to view the resources consumed by the transaction.
</Accordion>



<Accordion title="Why are some TRON transactions not using delegated resources?">
In the following special cases, some transactions may not be able to be delegated:

* The address is not activated (no TRX transaction record), the first transaction will require TRX consumption.

* Due to peak transaction periods, Keysecure's system resources may be insufficient, and TRX may need to be directly consumed from the wallet address.
