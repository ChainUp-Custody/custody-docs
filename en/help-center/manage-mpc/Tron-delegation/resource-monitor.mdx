title: TRON Network Resource Monitoring
---

  
## Introduction

On the TRON blockchain, resource consumption does not disappear immediately but gradually recovers within 24 hours. Once recovered, the resources can be delegated again to the designated addresses, effectively reducing transaction costs. To help clients better manage their resources, many users wish to monitor the real-time fluctuations in resource amounts on their addresses, analyze consumption patterns, and decide whether to stake or unstake TRX based on the data, thereby optimizing resource allocation and cost control.


If a client acquires resources through staking TRX but is concerned that the resources may not be sufficient to cover transactions or wishes to optimize their existing staking plan, the TRON network resource tool provided by Custody will be the ideal solution. This tool allows real-time tracking of resource usage on TRON network addresses, helping you optimize resource allocation and quickly respond to the risk of insufficient resources.

  ### Enter the monitoring address and set the alert threshold.

  When the available resources of the monitored address fall below the set threshold, the system will automatically send an alert email to notify you to promptly check the resource status. The alert check occurs every 10 minutes, ensuring that you can respond in a timely manner to avoid resource shortages affecting transactions.
