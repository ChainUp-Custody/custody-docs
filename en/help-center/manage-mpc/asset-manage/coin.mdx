The Coin Management feature in the MPC wallet allows users to display only the cryptocurrencies they are interested in on the asset page. This enables users to easily track the prices, asset status, and transaction trends of the selected cryptocurrencies. It also makes the asset page cleaner and clearer, showing only the asset information of the cryptocurrencies the user is interested in, avoiding information overload.

<Tip>
Only the asset information of successfully followed cryptocurrencies will be displayed on the wallet page.
