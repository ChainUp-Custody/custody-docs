## Introduction

### Asset Management 

The MPC Wallet Web Interface provides a visual data dashboard, allowing users to quickly understand the current asset distribution within the MPC wallet. Users can manually adjust fund scheduling according to their needs to achieve a balance between hot and cold storage.



### Contract Address
1. View and edit the addresses of hot wallet contracts and cold wallet contracts associated with different networks in the MPC wallet.


<Note>
Editing the addresses of hot and cold wallet contracts requires approval from the workspace strategy.


</Note>

2. View the system-assigned vote-free transfer addresses

Please review the addresses and configure them within the corresponding hot wallet contracts. Vote-free transfer addresses will automatically initiate transactions for hot-to-warm, warm-to-hot, and warm-to-cold transfers according to the fund scheduling strategy. This ensures that funds are distributed proportionally and meets the daily transaction needs of the hot wallet.




<Note>
The configuration is considered successful only after a signatory of the hot wallet logs into the smart contract platform, initiates a proposal to configure the vote-free transfer addresses, and the proposal is approved.


</Note>

### Alert Notifications


The MPC Wallet Web Interface also supports event monitoring and alert functionalities to ensure users can respond promptly to critical events:

1. Address Asset Balance Monitoring: The system continuously monitors the asset quantity in the wallet. If an address balance falls below the configured parameter, the system will trigger an alert and send a notification to the designated email address.

2. Task Status Monitoring: The system monitors the status of tasks such as hot-to-warm, warm-to-cold, and warm-to-hot transfers, and reports the status to the client.

These monitoring and alert features help users manage and protect their assets more effectively, ensuring the security of their funds.





### Assets Flow Management
The MPC Wallet Web Interface also supports viewing and filtering transaction details for scheduling tasks across all networks, ensuring that users can comprehensively understand and manage their scheduling tasks.
