title: About Auto Sweep

## I. Overview

The Auto Sweep feature enables the automatic consolidation of assets through an interface, allowing the system to systematically aggregate assets scattered across different addresses or accounts into specific target addresses or accounts based on preset rules, thereby facilitating more efficient asset management and consolidation without manual intervention.

The main functions of Auto Sweep are as follows:

**Asset Management Consolidation**: When users hold the same type of currency in multiple addresses or accounts, the API interface can automatically consolidate these scattered assets into a primary address or account for easier management and monitoring.

**Reduction of Manual Operations**: The Auto Sweep function supports users in autonomously configuring relevant parameters, and the system will automatically execute asset consolidation operations, thereby eliminating the tedious manual transfer process, especially suitable for high-frequency trading or large-scale asset consolidation.

**Optimization of Exchange Processes**: Exchanges or service providers can utilize Auto Sweep to optimize users' asset management experience, reducing the number of transactions and fees, and improving overall efficiency.
