title: About Sweep All Coins
---

##  Overview

The Sweep All Coins feature achieves the automatic integration of assets through an interface, allowing the system to systematically sweep assets scattered across different addresses or accounts to a specific target address or account based on preset rules. This facilitates more efficient asset management and integration without manual intervention.

The main benefits of Sweep All Coins feature are:

**Distributed Asset Management**: When a user holds the same type of coin in multiple addresses or accounts, you can integrate these scattered assets into a primary address or account by API, making it more convenient for management and monitoring.

**Reduced Manual Operations**: The Sweep All Coins feature allows users to configure relevant parameters independently, and the system will automatically execute the asset sweeping operation, avoiding the cumbersome manual transfer process. This is particularly suitable for high-frequency trading or large-scale asset sweeping operation.

**Exchange Process Optimization**: Exchanges or service providers can utilize Sweep All Coins feature to optimize users' asset management experience, reduce the number of transactions and fees, and improve overall efficiency.
