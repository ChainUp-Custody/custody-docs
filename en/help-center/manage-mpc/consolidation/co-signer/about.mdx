title: About Co-Signer Consolidation
---

## I. Overview

The Co-Signer automatic consolidation feature achieves the automatic integration of assets through an interface, allowing the system to systematically consolidate assets scattered across different addresses or accounts to a specific target address or account based on preset rules. This facilitates more efficient asset management and integration without manual intervention.

The main benefits of Co-Signer automatic consolidation are:

**Distributed Asset Management**: When a user holds the same type of currency in multiple addresses or accounts, the API consolidation feature can integrate these scattered assets into a primary address or account, making it more convenient for management and monitoring.

**Reduced Manual Operations**: Co-Signer automatic consolidation allows users to configure relevant parameters independently, and the system will automatically execute the asset consolidation operation, avoiding the cumbersome manual transfer process. This is particularly suitable for high-frequency trading or large-scale asset consolidation.

**Exchange Process Optimization**: Exchanges or service providers can utilize Co-Signer automatic consolidation to optimize users' asset management experience, reduce the number of transactions and fees, and improve overall efficiency.
