##  Overview

The Sweep All Coins feature is a convenient and automated feature designed to help you manage digital assets efficiently. By configuring Co-Signer's API and auto sweep rules, the system will periodically scan asset balances and execute sweeping or auto fueling operations based on your rules. With no manual intervention required, it achieves the automatic centralized management of assets.

Through API Co-Signer Sweeping Execution, we aim to provide you with a more intelligent and efficient digital asset management experience, ensuring that your assets are effectively swept and managed.
