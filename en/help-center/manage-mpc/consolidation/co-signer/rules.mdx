title: Configure Auto Sweep Rules
---


## I. Overview

Upon configuring auto-sweep rules, the CryptSafe system executes corresponding sweeping operations based on the specified sweeping strategy. This results in the assets on wallets/addresses within the sweeping scope being uniformly transferred to the designated sweeping wallet address. In cases where the wallet (withdrawal address) being swept lacks gas fees, the Gas Station will recharge the wallet's network native tokens according to the set refueling strategy.

### Prerequisites for Using the Feature

Please ensure that the workspace is not expired, as expiration will render all wallet-related business functions unusable.

Ensure that API and Co-Signer configurations are completed to ensure the normal operation of the API, thereby enabling the auto-sweep function to execute smoothly.

Please upgrade the App version to **6.4.5** or higher.

## II. Configuring Auto Sweep Rules

Auto sweep encompasses four dimensions:

1. Configuring Omnibus Wallet and Gas Station
2. Determining the Sweeping Scope
3. Configuring Sweeping Strategy

### Step 1: Configuring Omnibus Wallet and Gas Station

#### What is an Omnibus Wallet?

An Omnibus Wallet is responsible for consolidating assets scattered across different wallets into its address.

#### What is a Gas Station?

A Gas Station is a service responsible for replenishing gas fees for corresponding wallets. When an application wallet fails to initiate a sweeping transfer due to insufficient gas fees, the Gas Station provides necessary gas fee support.

#### **Operation Steps**

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Auto Sweep Function">
Use the CryptSafe App to scan the QR code and configure via the "Auto Sweep" feature.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Configuration">
Use the CryptSafe App to scan the provided QR code and sign with local private key fragments to confirm the configuration of the Omnibus Wallet and Gas Station.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Notes**

In this step, co-managers can select wallets under the workspace and initiate corresponding configurations. It is important to note that the Omnibus Wallet and Gas Station can be the same.

Ensure that the selected Omnibus Wallet and Gas Station are available. Sweeping and refueling functions can only operate when they are in an available state. If the selected Omnibus Wallet or Gas Station is found to be deactivated, promptly make modifications to ensure the system's normal operation.

If your Omnibus Wallet and Gas Station have multiple addresses for the same asset, only the commonly used addresses can be used as sweeping destination addresses or refueling withdrawal addresses. After configuration, you can view detailed information on the commonly used addresses.

</Warning>

### Step 2: Determining the Sweeping Scope

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Notes**

Determine which wallets' assets will be swept. Note that the Omnibus Wallet and Gas Station will automatically be excluded from the sweeping scope.

Co-managers can decide the sweeping scope based on wallet types: `All Wallets`, `All API-Created Wallets`, `Single Wallet`.

If your wallet has multiple addresses with assets that need to be swept, all assets of the wallet's addresses will be included in the sweeping scope.

</Warning>

### Step 3: Configuring Sweeping Strategy

To simplify usage, the system automatically generates sweeping strategies for all applicable currencies under the workspace. Users can directly apply these strategies without manual intervention. They can also flexibly adjust strategy values to meet their needs. If users do not wish to sweep certain currencies, simply deactivate the corresponding strategies.


<Warning>
**Key Steps and Notes**

All sweeping orders will adhere to default refueling strategy: If a wallet fails to initiate a sweeping transfer due to insufficient gas fees, the Gas Station will be responsible for replenishing the gas fees for the corresponding wallet. The replenishment amount will be determined based on the estimated gas fee of the sweeping order itself.

All sweeping and refueling orders will adhere to default refueling strategy: All sweeping and refueling orders will follow CryptSafe system's default acceleration strategy to expedite sweeping completion.

</Warning>

## III. Other Features

**Notification**

If your sweeping business lacks the required network native token gas fees, the CryptSafe system will send notification emails to ensure you are promptly informed and can take necessary actions. Once the system detects that the sweeping business lacks the required network native token gas fees, reminder emails will be sent to the set notification email address.

**Signature Encryption**

To ensure the security of the sweeping process, signing encryption of the Omnibus Wallet's address is required. This step is performed for new network support or modifications to the sweeping wallet. admins and owners should sign and encrypt all new sweeping destination addresses to maintain the security of the asset sweeping process.

<Warning>

**Key Steps and Notes**

Co-managers can set up to 5 different notification email addresses in the system.

Editing and modifying email addresses require GA verification.
