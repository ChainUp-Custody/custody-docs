title: Configure Co-Signer Rules
---

##  Overview

After users configure Co-Signer consolidation rules, the Custody system will execute corresponding consolidation operations based on the defined consolidation strategy. This will result in the assets on wallets/addresses within the consolidation application scope being uniformly transferred to the preset consolidation wallet address. In cases where the wallet to be consolidated (withdrawal address) lacks mining fees, the gas station will recharge the wallet's mainnet coin according to the set refueling strategy.

<Tip>
It is strongly recommended not to actively configure contract consolidation strategies and Co-Signer consolidation strategies for the same asset simultaneously. If you make a mistake, the system will execute the consolidation strategy configured earliest based on the time of your configuration.
</Tip>

###  Prerequisites for Using the Feature

Please ensure that the main wallet has not expired, as expiration will render all wallet-related business functions unusable.

Ensure that API and Co-Signer have been configured to ensure the normal operation of the API, enabling the smooth execution of Co-Signer's consolidation function.

Upgrade the App version to **6.4.5** or above.

##  Configure Co-Signer Consolidation Rules

Co-Signer consolidation involves four dimensions:

1. Configure Consolidation Wallet and Gas Station
2. Determine the Consolidation Application Scope
3. Configure Consolidation Strategy
4. Configure Refueling Strategy

###  Step One: Configure Consolidation Wallet and Gas Station

#### What is a Consolidation Wallet

A consolidation wallet is responsible for consolidating assets dispersed in other different wallets to its address.

#### What is a Gas Station

A gas station is responsible for replenishing mining fees to the corresponding wallet. When the application wallet fails to initiate the consolidation transfer due to a lack of mining fees, the gas station will provide the necessary mining fee support.

#### **Operating Steps**
<Steps>
<Step title="Open Co-Signer Consolidation Feature">
    Use the "Consolidation Management - Co-Signer Consolidation" feature on the Custody Web portal by scanning the QR code with the Custody App.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Configuration">
    Use the Custody App to scan the provided QR code and sign with local key fragments to confirm the configuration of the consolidation wallet and gas station.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

In this step, co-managers can choose the sub-wallets under the main wallet and initiate the corresponding configuration. It's worth noting that the consolidation wallet and gas station can be the same.

Ensure to check if the selected consolidation wallet and gas station are available. The consolidation and refueling functions will only work when they are in an available state. If you find that the selected consolidation wallet or gas station is disabled, make timely modifications to ensure the normal operation of the system.

If your consolidation wallet and gas station have multiple addresses for the same asset, only commonly used addresses can be used as the consolidation destination address or refueling withdrawal address. After configuration, you can view the details of the specific commonly used addresses.
</Warning>

###  Step Two: Determine the Scope of Consolidation Application

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

Decide which sub-wallets' assets will be consolidated. Note that the consolidation wallet and gas station will be automatically excluded from the consolidation application scope.

Co-managers can decide the consolidation application scope based on the sub-wallet's type: `All Sub-Wallets`, `All API-Created Sub-Wallets`, `Single Wallet`.

If your sub-wallet has multiple addresses with assets to be consolidated, all assets of the wallet's addresses will be within the consolidation application scope.

</Warning>

###  Step Three: Configure Consolidation Strategy

Configuring the consolidation strategy is a crucial step, involving deciding which currencies will be consolidated, the threshold to trigger consolidation, and other related conditions.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

Decide which currencies will be consolidated, the threshold to trigger consolidation, and other conditions: In this step, co-managers need to carefully consider the currencies to be consolidated, set the threshold to trigger consolidation, and determine other relevant conditions.

Batch create and manage consolidation strategies: Co-managers can batch create multiple currency consolidation strategies, with newly created strategies being enabled by default. After successful creation, consolidation strategies can be edited, deleted, and closed in batches.

Define when the gas station will replenish the gas fee to the sub-wallet to support consolidation: Co-managers need to clearly define under what conditions consolidation orders and refueling orders will be created to ensure the normal progress of consolidation while consuming a reasonable range of gas fees.

Special considerations for consolidating the main currency: If consolidating the main currency, be sure to fill in the threshold and supplementary quantity of the consolidation strategy and gas replenishment strategy carefully. It is recommended to set the consolidation threshold higher than the supplementary quantity to ensure that the required gas fee will not cause operational issues due to consolidation.

Comply with Custody system's default acceleration strategy: All consolidation orders will comply with Custody system's default acceleration strategy to expedite the consolidation process.
</Warning>



###  Step Four: Configure Refueling Strategy
The refueling strategy will determine under what conditions the gas station will replenish the gas fee to the sub-wallet to support consolidation.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

Co-managers can create strategies on the main chain currency level, i.e., when the consolidated currency lacks the gas fee required for consolidation, the gas station needs to replenish how much of the main chain currency.

Newly created refueling strategies are enabled by default. After successful creation, refueling strategies can be edited, deleted, and closed in batches.

Comply with Custody system's default acceleration strategy: All refueling orders will comply with Custody system's default acceleration strategy to expedite the refueling process.
</Warning>

##  Other Feature: Notification Messages

If your consolidation business lacks the required gas fee main chain currency, the Custody system will send you notification emails to ensure that you are informed in a timely manner and can take necessary actions. Once the system detects that the consolidation business lacks the required gas fee main chain currency, it will send a reminder email to the set notification mailbox.

<Warning>

**Key Steps and Considerations**

Co-managers can set up to 5 different notification mailboxes in the system.

Editing and modifying the mailbox require GA verification.
</Warning>
