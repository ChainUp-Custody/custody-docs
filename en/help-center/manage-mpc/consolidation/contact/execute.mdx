title: Execute Contract Consolidation
---

##  Overview
This document aims to guide you on how to execute contract consolidation, systematically aggregating assets dispersed across different wallets to a specified wallet address. Before proceeding with the steps below, ensure that you have fully configured the contract rules and completed the necessary authorization. Note that only sub-wallets with completed authorization and the specified assets for consolidation can execute contract consolidation operations.

Assuming your wallet assets have reached the strategy threshold for contract consolidation, you can consolidate the assets to the designated wallet address using either **Manual Consolidation** or **Automatic Consolidation**.

##  Manual Consolidation

Through the Custody App, you can manually initiate the consolidation address to execute contract consolidation. This approach provides the flexibility of user-initiated control.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

- If there are multiple sub-wallets to be consolidated and considering fluctuations in the mainnet Gas fees, multiple signatures may be required to complete the consolidation task to prevent potential failures due to Gas fee changes.

- Due to security considerations, manual consolidation requires signing by the consolidation wallet to ensure the trustworthiness of the executed contract consolidation operation.

- During the manual consolidation process, you will need to pay the corresponding Gas fees.
</Warning>

##  Automatic Consolidation

The Custody platform's contract consolidation supports automatic consolidation, compatible with all MPC merchants, whether they have an active API or not. If you need to activate the automatic consolidation feature, please contact the customer support team promptly. They will provide detailed guidance and support to ensure the smooth operation of your automatic consolidation service.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

Automatic consolidation requires you to handle contract deployment, sub-wallet authorization, and the Gas fees required for automatic consolidation. Ensure that you have completed these necessary preparations before initiating the automatic consolidation service.
