title: Sweeping ERC-20 Tokens
---

##  Overview
This document aims to guide you on how to sweep ERC-20 tokens, systematically aggregating assets dispersed across different wallets to a specified wallet address. Before proceeding with the steps below, ensure that you have fully configured the contract rules and completed the necessary authorizations. Please note that only sub-wallets with completed authorization can sweep ERC-20 tokens.

Assuming your wallet assets have reached the strategy threshold for sweep ERC-20 tokens, you can sweep the assets to the designated wallet address using either **Manual Sweeping** or **Automatic Sweeping**.

##  Manual Sweeping

Through the CryptSafe App, you can manually initiate the sweeping address to sweep ERC-20 tokens. This approach provides the flexibility of user-initiated control.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

- If there are multiple sub-wallets to be swept and considering fluctuations in the mainnet Gas fees, multiple signatures may be required to complete the sweepingn task to prevent potential failures due to Gas fee changes.

- Due to security considerations, manual sweeping requires signing by the aimed wallet to ensure the trustworthiness of the executed operation.

- During the manual sweeping process, you will need to pay the corresponding gas fees.
