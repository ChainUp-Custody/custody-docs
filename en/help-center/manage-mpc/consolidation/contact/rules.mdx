title: Configure Auto Sweeping Rules
---

##  Overview
Creating smart contracts and configuring auto sweeping rules through the CryptSafe Web interface ensures that the system executes corresponding auto sweep operations according to the rules during the sweeping process. Simultaneously, by authorizing sub-wallets for sweeping contract in the App, you can precisely determine which sub-wallets have the right to sweep assets.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

CryptSafe platform only supports `Web3 sub-wallets` for sweeping.

Each sub-wallet and token that needs sweeping must be authorized in advance.

It is strongly recommended not to configure the same asset strategy for both the Sweep ERC-20 Tokens feature and the Sweep All Coins feature simultaneously. If an error occurs, the system will execute the sweeping operation configured earliest based on the time of your operation.

##  Configure Auto Sweeping Rule Process

Configuring auto sweeping rules involves three processes:

1. Create and publish a sweeping contract.

2. Configure sweeping assets.

3. Contract authorization.

###  Step 1: Create and Publish a Sweeping Contract

<Steps>
<Step title="Create and Publish a Sweeping Contract">
    In the MPC web interface, select "Sweep ERC-20 Tokens," and click "+" to create a sweeping contract.
</Step>
<Step title="Edit Auto Sweep Rules">
   1. Enter the rule name, select the main chain, and confirm the sweeping address.

   2. Choose the aimed sub-wallet to receive assets.
</Step>
<Step title="Sign and Publish the Contract">
    The private key holder signs using the CryptSafe App to scan the code, and the auto sweep rule is successfully published.
</Step>
</Steps>

###  Step 2: Configure Sweeping Assets

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit Sweeping Threshold">
    Click Edit button on the Sweep ERC-20 Tokens page, and click "+" on the edit page to add tokens.
</Step>
<Step title="Edit Sweeping Threshold">
    After adding the tokens that need sweeping, click "Edit Threshold" to set the sweeping threshold: **trigger auto sweeping when the asset amount exceeds the threshold.**
</Step>
</Steps>

###  Step 3: Contract Authorization

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Sweep Tokens Feature">
    Log in and open the CryptSafe App, switch to the MPC system, and open the "Discover - Sweep Tokens" function.
</Step>
<Step title="Authorization Management">
   Click on "Authorization Management" . The private key holder needs to sign with the private key to authorize the sub-wallet.

  <Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

For each type of asset to be swept in the sub-wallets requiring auto sweeping via 'sweep,' individual authorizations are necessary. For sub-wallets that do not require sweeping, simply deselect the 'sweep' option.

Please use the CryptSafe App's [Discover] - [Sweep Tokens] function, click to select the main wallet that has configured the sweeping contract for authorization.
</Warning>
