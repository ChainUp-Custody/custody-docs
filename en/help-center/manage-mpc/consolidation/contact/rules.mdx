title: Configure Contract Consolidation Rules
---

##  Overview
Creating smart contracts and configuring consolidation rules through the Custody web interface ensures that the system executes corresponding consolidation operations according to the rules during the consolidation process. Simultaneously, by authorizing sub-wallets for contract consolidation in the App, you can precisely determine which sub-wallets have the right to consolidate.

<Warning>
**Important Note**

ChainUp Custody platform only supports `Web3 sub-wallets` for contract consolidation.

Each sub-wallet and token that needs consolidation must be authorized in advance.

It is highly recommended not to configure contract consolidation policies and Co-signer consolidation policies for the same asset simultaneously. If you do so, the system will execute the policy configured earlier based on the configuration time.
</Warning>

##  Configure Contract Rule Process

Configuring contract rules involves three processes:

1. Create and publish a consolidation contract.

2. Configure consolidation assets.

3. Contract authorization.

###  Step 1: Create and Publish a Consolidation Contract

<Steps>
<Step title="Create and Publish a Consolidation Contract">
    In the MPC web interface, select "Consolidation Management," and click "+" to create a consolidation contract.
</Step>
<Step title="Edit Consolidation Rules">
   1. Enter the consolidation rule name, select the main chain, and confirm the consolidation address.

   2. Choose the sub-wallet to consolidate the funds into.
</Step>
<Step title="Sign and Publish the Contract">
    The private key holder signs using the Custody App to scan the code, and the consolidation rule is successfully published.
</Step>
</Steps>

###  Step 2: Configure Consolidation Assets

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit Consolidation Threshold">
    Click "Edit Consolidation" on the consolidation management page, and click "+" on the edit page to add consolidation tokens.
</Step>
<Step title="Edit Consolidation Threshold">
    After adding the tokens that need consolidation, click "Edit Threshold" to set the consolidation threshold: **trigger contract consolidation when the asset amount exceeds the threshold.**
</Step>
</Steps>

###  Step 3: Contract Authorization

<Steps>
<Step title="Open MPC Token Consolidation">
    Log in and open the Custody App, switch to the MPC system, and open the "Discover - MPC Token Consolidation" function.
</Step>
<Step title="Authorization Management">
   Click on "Authorization Management" in the consolidation tool. The private key holder needs to sign with the private key to authorize the sub-wallet.

  <Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

Each type of consolidation asset in the sub-wallet that needs consolidation must be authorized separately. Only canceling consolidation is needed for sub-wallets that do not require consolidation.

Please use the Custody App's [Discover] - [MPC Token Consolidation] function, click to select the main wallet that has configured the consolidation contract for authorization.
