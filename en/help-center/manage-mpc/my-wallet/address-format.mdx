##  Address Types

MPC Wallet supports various address types, including UTXO types, account types, and Memo types. UTXO types use Legacy addresses, suitable for main chains like Bitcoin that adopt the UTXO model. Account types are suitable for main chains with account addresses, such as ETH, BSC, HECO, etc., generated using the Bip-44 standard. The Memo type ensures the uniqueness of the deposit address by including the Memo field during API creation, providing additional identification information.

**Account Type**:

When creating a wallet for the account type of the main chain you're interested in, the system generates an account type address. Specifically, addresses for ETH and most main chains based on the EVM network (like ETH, BSC, HECO, etc.) are the same.

The MPC Wallet currently supports wallet creation for account types, generating addresses, and specifying addresses for deposits or withdrawals (API only). The first created address is marked as the default address, and manual deposit and withdrawal transactions default to using the default address.

<Tip> 
You cannot view the asset information for multiple addresses in the account type on the App or PC, and you cannot specify an address for manual deposits or withdrawals.

**UTXO Type**:

When you create a wallet for the account type of the main chain you're interested in, the system generates UTXO Legacy addresses. Legacy addresses use the original Bitcoin address format, starting with "1," associated with the hash output of your private key's public key.

Custody also supports manually or API creating UTXO multiple addresses, with the second created address used as the change address to receive unused UTXO in transfers. [Learn more about change addresses](/help-center/manage-mpc/my-wallet/change-address).

**Memo Type**:

Memo is a digital string that ensures the uniqueness of the deposit address, appearing in pairs with the deposit address and corresponding one to one. It is important to note that Memo type addresses created through the App do not have a Memo field, while Memo type addresses created through the API include a Memo field.



##  Address Consolidation

To reduce the complexity of managing too many addresses, MPC Wallet supports address consolidation. Currently, the supported protocols for address consolidation are as follows:

Protocols supporting address consolidation (I): BTC, BCH

Protocols supporting address consolidation (II): ETH, ARB, BSC, HECO, FEVM, ETC, MATIC, AVAX-C
