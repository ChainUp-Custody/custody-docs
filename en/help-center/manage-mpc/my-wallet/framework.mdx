title: Workspace Architecture
---

Keysecure's MPC workspace is based on a four-layer structure, including accounts, workspaces, wallets, and coin addresses, aiming to facilitate different businesses and departments to manage their own funds and approval processes.

## I. Structure Overview

1. One account can create multiple workspaces.

2. One workspace can create multiple wallets.

3. Each wallet supports multiple coins, and each coin can have one or more addresses.

<Tip> 
To understand multi-address coins, you can read [Address Format](/help-center/manage-mpc/my-wallet/address-format) for related information.

<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <img src="/images/help-center/accounten.png" width="200"/>
</div>

## II. Practical Cases

1. MPC workspace can be used for asset statistics of a certain business line, while wallets can be allocated to different users.

2. MPC workspace can also be used for company total asset statistics, while wallets are allocated to different business departments.

<Tip> 
When you stop using, or when Keysecure service is not available, you can use the exclusive [Offline Private Key Recovery Tool](/help-center/manage-mpc/my-wallet/off-line-tool) to obtain the complete private key of the created wallet.
