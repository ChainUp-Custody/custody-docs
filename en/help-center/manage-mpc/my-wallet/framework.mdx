ChainUp Custody's MPC wallet is based on a four-layer structure, including Account, Main Wallet, Sub-Wallet, and Coin Type Address. It aims to facilitate different businesses and departments in managing their funds and approval processes.

##  Structure Overview

1. An account can create multiple main wallets.

2. A main wallet can create multiple sub-wallets.

3. Each sub-wallet supports multiple coin types, and each asset coin type can have one or more addresses.

<Tip> 
To understand multi-address coin types, you can read [Address Format](/help-center/manage-mpc/my-wallet/address-format) for more information.

##  Practical Cases
MPC main wallets can be used for asset statistics for a specific business line, while sub-wallets can be allocated to different users.

MPC main wallets can also be used for the overall asset statistics of the company, while sub-wallets are allocated to different business departments.
<Tip> 
When you terminate usage or if ChainUp Custody services are unavailable, you can use the dedicated [Offline Private Key Recovery Tool](/help-center/manage-mpc/my-wallet/off-line-tool) to obtain the complete private keys of the created wallets.
