As a decentralized enterprise-level wallet, ChainUp Custody does not store customers' private keys. If you want to recover the private keys of your created MPC wallet, you can download and use ChainUp Custody's offline private key recovery tool. By using this tool in an offline environment, you can recover the complete private keys of all MPC wallets. Once the private key recovery is successful, you can import it into other hardware or software wallets, fully controlling your digital assets.
