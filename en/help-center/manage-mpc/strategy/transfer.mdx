title: MPC Workspace Strategy Engine
---

## I. Overview
ChainUp Custody's strategy engine provides your MPC workspace with a powerful transaction rule customization feature, used for precise management and control of outgoing transactions. This flexible system allows you to define a series of transaction rules according to personalized needs, ensuring the security and effective circulation of assets. These rules can control the transfer approval process of specific assets, clearly defining users who can approve transactions.

The ChainUp Custody strategy engine includes the following features: transfer strategy, miner fee strategy, and signature protection.

### I.I Transfer Strategy

The system will automatically apply your defined transfer strategy to all transfer transactions manually created through the Web or App. Once a member initiates a transfer request, the related transfer strategy will take the corresponding action according to the rules you set:

**Approve Transaction:** When the transaction reaches the approval threshold, it is automatically submitted to the workspace administrator or creator for signature confirmation, then broadcasted to the blockchain.

**Reject Transaction:** When the transaction does not reach the approval threshold, it is automatically terminated to ensure unauthorized transactions cannot continue.

You can define the following parameters for the transfer strategy:

**Strategy Name:** Name the transfer strategy for easy identification.

**Approval Flow:** Set the approver and approval threshold to ensure the transfer goes through the proper approval process.

**Risk Control Assets:** Multiple selections of coins and NFTs are allowed, clarifying the range of assets protected by the strategy.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

We emphasize the importance of correctly implementing the transfer strategy. Your transfer strategy is a key layer of asset protection, please customize it according to your business needs.

An MPC wallet can create multiple transfer strategies, but the transfer strategy for each asset must be unique.

If an asset has never edited a transfer strategy, the transaction of the asset defaults to only require the workspace owner's final signature confirmation.

Transactions initiated by API are not managed by the transfer strategy.
</Warning>

### I.II Miner Fee Strategy

The system will automatically apply your defined miner fee strategy to each manual customization of the miner fee to prevent misoperations or malicious operations that lead to overpayment of miner fees.

<Tip>
Workspace creators can set different miner fee strategies for their workspaces. For specific operations, please refer to [Miner Fee Strategy](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/strategy/gas-fee-strategy).
</Tip>

### I.III Signature Protection

You can choose whether to enable signature protection. If you enable it, the signature operations of other equal rights private key holders will be restricted.

In transactions without an approval flow, non-creator private key holders will not be able to initiate and sign transactions that have not gone through the approval process.

For transactions with an approval flow, other private key holders cannot sign transactions that they initiated and approved.

<Tip>
Workspace creators can enable or disable signature protection for their workspaces. For specific operations, please refer to [Signature Protection](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/strategy/sign-protect).
</Tip>

## II. Who can manage the strategy engine?

Currently, only the MPC workspace owner has the authority to manage the strategy engine. All editing and viewing functions of the strategy engine are only provided on the Custody App.
