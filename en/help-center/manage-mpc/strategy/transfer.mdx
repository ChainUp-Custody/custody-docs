title: MPC Wallet Transfer Strategy
---

##  Overview
ChainUp Custody's policy engine provides powerful transaction rule customization for your MPC wallet, allowing precise management and control of outgoing transactions. This flexible system allows you to define a series of transaction rules based on personalized requirements, ensuring the safe and efficient circulation of assets. These rules can govern the approval process for the transfer of specific assets, specifying users authorized to approve transactions.

The ChainUp Custody policy engine automatically applies the transfer policies you define to all transfer transactions created manually through the web or app. Once a member initiates a transfer request, the relevant transfer policy will be applied by the approver based on the rules you have set:

**Approve Transaction:** When a transaction reaches the approval threshold, it is automatically submitted to the wallet administrator for signature confirmation and then broadcast to the blockchain.

**Reject Transaction:** When a transaction does not reach the approval threshold, it is automatically terminated, ensuring unauthorized transactions cannot proceed.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

Implementing transfer policies correctly is crucial. Your transfer policies are a critical layer of asset protection, so customize them according to your business needs.

Transactions initiated by MPC wallet administrators (wallet creators) are not governed by transfer policies.

Transactions initiated via API are not governed by transfer policies.
</Warning>

##  Who Can Manage the Policy Engine?

Currently, only MPC wallet administrators (wallet creators) have the authority to modify transfer policies. The functionality to edit and view transfer policies is available only on the Custody App.

##  Creating Transfer Policies

You can define the following parameters for transfer policies:

**Policy Name:** Name the transfer policy for easy identification.

**Approval Flow:** Set up approvers and approval thresholds to ensure transfers go through the appropriate approval process.

**Risk Control Assets:** Select multiple currencies and NFTs to specify the range of assets protected by the policy.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

A single MPC wallet can create multiple transfer policies, but each asset's transfer policy must be unique.

If an asset has never had a transfer policy edited, transactions for that asset will default to requiring only the wallet administrator's final signature confirmation.
</Warning>
