title: Workspace Strategy Engine

##  I. Overview
To enhance internal controls and collaborative governance within the workspace, and to prevent unauthorized modifications to core functions that may lead to internal risks and financial losses, CryptoSafe offers Workspace Strategies to users. These strategies facilitate easy control over critical operations at the workspace level. Once approval policies are set, all significant operations within the workspace will strictly adhere to these rules, eliminating any possibility of circumvention or tampering.

##  II. Workspace Strategies
Workspace Strategies serve as control mechanisms for configuring workspace functionalities, ensuring that all critical operations require approval from the workspace strategies. This eliminates human errors and prevents collusion between internal and external parties.

<Note>
The current control scenarios for the workspace strategy include: API management, viewing recovery phrases, and workspace strategy management.

The system creates a default workspace strategy for all new workspaces, with the owner automatically designated as the approver.
