title: TRON Automated Delegation
---

## Introduction
The TRON blockchain employs a unique fee model, different from blockchains like Ethereum. It does not use a fixed Gas fee but instead utilizes two resources—bandwidth and energy—for transactions.
- Transferring TRX and TRC-10 tokens consumes bandwidth.
- Transferring TRC-20 tokens or executing contracts consumes both bandwidth and energy.

**If the wallet does not have the required resources for the transaction, TRX must be directly burned from the address or replenished through the fueling station to support TRON network transactions.**

## Delegation Tool
Directly burning TRX to pay miner fees can be costly. To help clients save on transaction fees and reduce operational costs, the Custody system has launched an automatic delegation tool. This tool allows all addresses under the workstation to acquire TRON transaction resources as needed for transactions, without consuming TRX. Clients only need to pay a small service fee to complete the transaction.

**Cost Savings:** After using the automatic delegation mechanism, the system will automatically provide the required energy for the wallet, eliminating the need for users to use TRX to pay miner fees. Typically, the delegation fee is cheaper than directly using TRX.

**One-Step Operation:** Once you active permission and enable the feature, every transaction will be fully covered with resources, ensuring that no TRX is consumed during the transaction process and reducing operational complexity.

## III. Operation

**Accessing the TRON Automated Delegation Tool**


Log in to the MPC workspace, go to [More] - [Toolbox], and access the tool.

</div>


You can also find the entry to the TRON Auto Delegation tool on the details page of the auto-aggregation feature or on the transfer page for TRON network tokens.

<Tip> 
Please configure the gas station wallet first before using the tool.
</Tip>

**Activing Transfer Permission to Enable Delegation Feature**

Allow Custody's authorized address to settle and automatically deduct Delegation Service Fee from your wallet.

<Note>
Activating transfer permission requires approval through the gas station wallet's strategy. Once permission is activated, the system will automatically delegate TRON transaction resources for all addresses in the workspace, helping users reduce transaction costs. The delegation service fee will be periodically settled and deducted.

**The system automatically delegates resources and settles service fees**


The Custody system will regularly settle the delegation service fees based on the actual resources consumed and automatically initiate fee deduction transactions from the gas station.

<Note>
If the gas station balance is insufficient to cover the delegation service fees, the system will not immediately stop the automatic delegation feature. The unpaid fees will be deferred and deducted once the gas station balance is replenished. However, please note that if the outstanding amount remains too high and is not addressed in a timely manner, the system may suspend the automatic delegation service.
</Note>






## Billing Rules
### Using Delegated Resources

The system will calculate the delegation service fee based on the actual resources consumed by the transaction. Custody will regularly track the amount of service fees pending payment and initiate a transaction to deduct the fee from the user's authorized wallet address.

**Delegation Service Fee = [Energy consumed by transaction * Energy price + Bandwidth consumed by transaction * Bandwidth price] * Custody service rate**

Energy price: 1 Energy = 0.00021 TRX

Bandwidth price: 1 Bandwidth = 0.001 TRX

<Note> 
The prices of energy and bandwidth are set by the TRON network.
</Note>

Custody service rate: A dynamic percentage, always less than 100%, which will be adjusted periodically based on actual conditions.

For example, if the user transfers USDT and consumes 65,000 energy and 300 bandwidth:

Resource consumption value of the transaction:

Energy consumption: 65,000 Energy × 0.00021 = 13.65 TRX

Bandwidth consumption: 300 Bandwidth × 0.001 = 0.3 TRX

**Total resource consumption value** = 13.65 + 0.3 = 13.95 TRX

Custody service rate: 80%, meaning Custody will only charge 80% of the transaction's resource cost.

**Delegation service fee for the transaction** = 13.95 × 80% = 11.16 TRX, which is lower than directly burning TRX to pay for miner fees, resulting in reduced transaction costs.


### Not Using Delegated Resources

If the transaction is not covered by delegated resources, the system will default to consuming TRX from the user’s wallet as the withdrawal miner’s fee, and the on-chain displayed miner’s fee will be equivalent to the withdrawal miner’s fee.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How to understand the actual transaction resources consumed by an order?">
You can visit the blockchain explorer and query the transaction’s TXID to view the resources consumed by the transaction.
</Accordion>



<Accordion title="Why are some TRON transactions not using delegated resources?">
In the following special cases, some transactions may not be able to be delegated:

* The address is not activated (no TRX transaction record), the first transaction will require TRX consumption.

* Due to peak transaction periods, Custody's system resources may be insufficient, and TRX may need to be directly consumed from the wallet address.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to check the service consumption of the workspace?">
* If you want to check the settlement records of the delegation service fee, you can access the transaction details or query the delegation service fee information in the transaction records via the Web3 API.
* If you want to view the total consumption records of the delegation service fee, you can contact the Custody customer support team for the relevant information.
* If you want to check the outstanding balance of the delegation service fee, please contact the Custody customer support team for detailed information. If your outstanding balance exceeds a certain amount, the Custody team will contact you. If the balance is not replenished in time, the system will automatically suspend the delegation service.
