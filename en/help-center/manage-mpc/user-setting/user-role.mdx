title: MPC Wallet Member Roles
---

##  Overview

To ensure the security of wallet-related data and compliance with the company's financial approval system, as well as to safeguard the security of company funds, setting roles with different permissions is crucial for the wallet. In setting wallet roles, ChainUp Custody aims to find the best balance between security, compliance with approval processes, and user-friendliness.
Taking into account these factors, Custody MPC wallet roles are divided into three categories: Wallet Administrator, Approver, and Ordinary Member.

##  Role Descriptions

### Wallet Administrator
An administrator is the only user with full permissions for the MPC wallet. The creator of each main wallet is automatically the wallet administrator, with the highest management permissions for all sub-wallets under the main wallet. Each wallet has only one administrator.

#### Recommended Responsibilities
* Create sub-wallets
* Create new receiving addresses
* Add wallet members
* Modify member permissions
* Initiate and sign transactions
* Manage transaction approval policies
* Use the web3 sub-wallet to link DApps
* Manage FIL multi-signature wallets
* Manage FIL nodes
* Authorize sweeping contracts 
* Configure Co-Signer
* Create KYT
* Handle KYT risks
* Approve members


### Approval Memeber (Approver)
Approvers can approve transactions based on triggered transfer policies, and they also have the permissions of ordinary members.

#### Recommended Responsibilities
* Initiate transactions
* View bills
* View wallet information
* Handle transaction approvals
* Handle KYT risks
* Configure auto sweep rules for sweep ERC-20 tokens feature
* Configure auto sweep rules for sweep all coins feature

<Tip>
Wallet administrators can edit transfer policies through the "Security-Transfer Policy" of the Custody App, including adding members to the approval flow, and members added to the approval flow will automatically become approvers. Refer to [Transfer Policy](/help-center/manage-mpc/strategy/transfer) for the specific process.

### Ordinary Member
Ordinary members can initiate transactions, access allocated wallets, and query related information.

#### Recommended Responsibilities
