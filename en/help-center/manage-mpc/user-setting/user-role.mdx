title: MPC User Roles
---

## I. Overview
To ensure the safety of data related to the MPC system and compliance with the company's financial approval system, thus safeguarding company funds, we believe that setting roles with different permissions is crucial for the MPC workspace. In setting workspace roles, ChainUp Custody aims to balance the safety of funds and data with approval requirements, striving to find the best balance between security, compliance with approval processes, and user-friendliness. Taking these factors into account, the roles in the Custody MPC workspace are divided into three categories: workspace owner, admin, and wallet ordinary member.
