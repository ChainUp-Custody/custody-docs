title: Connecting to DApp
---

As the demand for accessibility and use of Web3 continues to grow, more users wish to manage their NFTs, claim rewards, and perform various actions directly through DApps. Keysecure's Web3 wallet linking feature allows your users to connect their wallet addresses directly to Web3 applications (DApps) without using other wallets or any additional applications.

 <Tip> 
Make sure your internet connection is stable and ensure that you have a Web3-type wallet for the corresponding main chain. Also, complete the necessary steps for private key signing authorization.
</Tip>


<Steps>
<Step title="Open Keysecure App">
    Open your Keysecure App and log in to your account.
</Step>
<Step title="Access the Discovery Module">
    Locate and click on the "Discovery" module in the bottom navigation bar.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the Desired DApp">
    Click on the DApp you want to access. This will take you to the DApp page, displaying relevant information.
</Step>
<Step title="Authorize the wallet">
    If you intend to use DApp features, you'll need to authorize the wallet through private key signing.

    If you haven't activated the main chain related to the DApp, the DApp functionality will not work. You need to activate the corresponding main chain before using the DApp feature.
    <Tip> 
Make sure you have activated a Web3-type wallet for the corresponding main chain; otherwise, DApp authorization won't be possible.
If your wallet doesn't support the main chain for the DApp, please contact the customer support team to enable it.
