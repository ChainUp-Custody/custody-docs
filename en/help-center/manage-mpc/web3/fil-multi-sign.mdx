title: FIL Multisig Wallet
---

##  Overview

The Filcoin mainnet provides functionality to manage wallet without private keys, known as FIL multi-signature (Multisig) wallets. Users can effectively manage these wallets by initiating proposals and voting on them.

FIL multi-signature wallets are suitable for the following business scenarios:

**1. Joint management of FIL assets by multiple shareholders:** Multiple shareholders can collectively manage FIL assets through multi-signature wallets. Manage and control your FIL assets scientifically based on the set number of shareholders and threshold.

**2. Multi-member management of FIL nodes:** You can use a multi-signature wallet as the owner or beneficiary of FIL nodes, achieving the functionality of multi-member management of FIL nodes.


###  Terms and Definitions

**Signer:** Participants in the multi-signature wallet.

**Threshold:** Specific conditions that multi-signature wallet proposals need to meet to be recorded on the blockchain.

**Proposal:** Transactions initiated by members of the multi-signature wallet.

**Proposal Voting:** Members of the multi-signature wallet confirm valid proposals that have not reached the threshold.

**f1 Address:** Address generated based on the private key using the secp256k1 algorithm on the FIL mainnet.

**f3 Address:** Address generated based on the private key using the BLS algorithm on the FIL mainnet.

**f2 Address:** Address generated on the FIL mainnet using a specific algorithm without a private key.

**f0 Address:** Field identifier in the FIL mainnet for the different types of new addresses mentioned above, equivalent to a code.


##  FIL Multi-Signature Wallet Transaction Flow

</div>

Signers in the multi-signature wallet initiate proposal transactions to the multi-signature wallet. Once the proposal is on-chain, other multi-signature members vote on it and confirm it on the blockchain. The blockchain checks whether the proposal has reached the threshold set by the current multi-signature wallet. Once the threshold conditions are met, the proposal is executed.

##  FIL Multi-Signature Features Supported by MPC Wallet

ChainUp Custody's MPC wallet now supports various features, including creating and managing FIL multi-signature wallets, managing signers and thresholds for multi-signature wallets, and performing balance withdrawals and proposal handling for multi-signature wallets.
