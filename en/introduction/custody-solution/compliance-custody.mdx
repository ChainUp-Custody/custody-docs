* **Self-Activation of Compliance Solutions**

CryptSafe collaborates with leading providers of digital asset compliance solutions, allowing users to independently choose integration solutions.

* **Integrate Compliance Checks into Every Transaction**

Users can enable real-time controls, risk scoring, and compliance operations for all receipt and transfer transactions. Each transaction is automatically filtered based on user-defined compliance policy rules and compliance provider data. After identifying high-risk transactions, the system automatically or manually decides whether to block the transaction based on the policy, preventing assets from flowing into risky wallet addresses. The compliance team can also freeze deposit transactions from potential risk addresses, ensuring the normal wallet addresses are not contaminated.
