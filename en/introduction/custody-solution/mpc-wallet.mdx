ChainUp Custody has built a secure digital asset self-custody wallet system for institutional users based on MPC (Secure Multi-Party Computation) - TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) technology. It provides multi-layer security guarantees and can be customized for asset, private key management, and disaster recovery plans.

- **One-stop Asset Management Platform**

ChainUp Custody supports users in managing MPC wallet assets on both the App and PC platforms. ChainUp Custody provides a user-friendly operation platform with powerful features, simple operations, and a clean interface. Users can securely store and access over 200 main chain assets from anywhere with a simple interface.

- **Distributed Key Storage Technology**

ChainUp Custody employs distributed key storage technology, allowing users to generate and manage all private key fragments. Users locally save one of the private key fragments, while the other two are stored in Amazon Cloud and Microsoft Cloud, respectively. This distributed storage method, combined with hardware isolation technology, enables users to have complete control over their assets. ChainUp Custody supports a 3-3 TSS configuration. When a user initiates a transaction signature, these three private key fragments simultaneously participate in the signing process, eliminating single-point failure issues in private key management and significantly enhancing the security of self-managed assets to the highest level in the market.

- **Convenient Backup and Recovery**

The MPC wallet supports users in quickly and conveniently managing their private keys. ChainUp Custody supports multiple backup methods for private keys, including local backup mnemonics and cloud backup. In cases where users change devices or experience any local private key loss, recovery can be achieved in a single step. Additionally, ChainUp Custody ensures that users have permanent ownership of the created MPC wallet. If users no longer use the ChainUp Custody platform's services, they can use the offline recovery tool with the private key to obtain the complete mnemonic of the created MPC wallet address. This can be imported into another wallet for continued use.

- **Full-Process Node Monitoring and Auditing**

Users can customize transaction strategies, and asset trading orders subject to risk control require approval from designated co-managers before entering the final signature broadcasting stage. The platform also provides full-process node monitoring for transactions, allowing users to intuitively understand the status of the transaction orders at each stage. This ensures a clear, complete, and traceable approval flow, meeting internal control and financial audit requirements. Simultaneously, it ensures the security and reliability of transactions.

- **Role-Based Operation Control**

ChainUp Custody's MPC wallet offers role-based access control, enabling strict management of wallet permissions. Users can define roles such as approvers and ordinary members, allowing for reasonable role assignment based on their organizational structure. This effectively isolates users' information access and operational permissions for different sub-wallets. Additionally, critical functions of the MPC wallet require validation through Google Authenticator or private key password, and users can also enable biometric verification to enhance efficiency.

- **Engaging Web3 Experience**

ChainUp Custody provides an end-to-end solution for building, protecting, and managing Web3 applications, games, and experiences. Users can easily access different Web3 projects, directly connect their Web3 wallet to dApps, and configure NFT trading strategies. This allows for easy tracking, auditing, and control of all Web3 wallet transactions.
