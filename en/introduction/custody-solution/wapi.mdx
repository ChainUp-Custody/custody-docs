Through our convenient and efficient WAPI integration solution, we seamlessly connect to your main chain, ensuring uninterrupted use.

Whether you have purchased MPC wallet services or Joint Custody services, ChainUp Custody supports over 200 popular main chains on the market, covering nearly 99% of business scenarios. However, if you encounter one of the following situations:

1. ChainUp Custody currently does not support the main chain you need.

2. You prefer not to pay for the usage of a particular main chain through ChainUp Custody.

ChainUp Custody never mandates that customers must pay for main chain services through our platform. If you have the internal capability, whether through your own technical team or third-party support, you can use ChainUp Custody's WAPI solution. Simply provide the necessary field information, with no additional development costs, and quickly integrate and use the main chain you need to meet your business requirements.
