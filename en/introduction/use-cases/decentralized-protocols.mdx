<Accordion title="Elimination of Single Points of Failure with MPC Technology">
ChainUp Custody adopts MPC encryption technology, enabling the creation and encryption of corresponding private key shares in isolated secure hardware enclaves across multiple cloud centers. During transaction signing, these key shares are used for multi-round computations without the need to transmit them to the same environment. Thus, MPC eliminates single points of compromise for private key creation and signing, ensuring higher security and privacy.
