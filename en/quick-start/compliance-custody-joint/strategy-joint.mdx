title: Configure KYT Policies
---

## I. Easily Configure and Automate Your Compliance Policies

ChainUp Custody collaborates with leading KYT service providers, allowing customers to perform real-time transaction monitoring directly from the ChainUp Custody compliance platform.

**Comprehensive Compliance Checks for Each Transaction:** Automatically filter every transaction based on the compliance policy rules you set and data from the compliance provider to prevent your team from sending transactions to high-risk wallets. Additionally, the compliance team can freeze inbound transactions from potential risk wallets for compliance assessment before using the funds.

**Customize Compliance Policy Engine:** Easily configure transaction rules based on your organization's compliance policies and integrate risk scores generated by KYT service providers to meet your needs.

**Provide a One-Stop Compliance Dashboard:** Allows customers to manage the policy rules of each KYT service provider directly through the platform, avoiding the complexity of managing multiple platforms.

<Warning>
Please note that only administrators of Joint Custody wallets can decide KYT policies!

### II. Compliance Assets and Corresponding Policies
You can determine which currencies' deposit and withdrawal transactions need KYT monitoring and decide under what conditions KYT verification should be triggered.

<Accordion title="1. Currency Quantity Policy">
When the transaction quantity of the currency is greater than or equal to a certain value, KYT verification is required for that transaction.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="2. Currency Value Policy">
When the transaction value of the currency is greater than or equal to a certain value (USD), KYT verification is required for that transaction.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Please note that either the currency quantity policy or the currency value policy can be effective, not both.
</Warning>

### III. Circuit Breaker Mechanism

The role of the circuit breaker mechanism is that once a specific risk level is triggered by a transaction, all subsequent transactions need to undergo KYT verification. You can choose whether to enable the circuit breaker strategy.
<Warning>
It is important to note that the circuit breaker mechanism takes precedence over the handling of alert levels. If the circuit breaker mechanism is enabled, all transactions for currencies that require KYT verification, regardless of the verification threshold, must undergo KYT verification.
</Warning>

For example, if the alert level for the circuit breaker mechanism is set to "High Risk," and a user has three deposit transactions to their address, where the first transaction has an alert level of "Severe" and the second and third transactions have an alert level of "Low." In this case, the user's address triggers the circuit breaker mechanism, and all three transactions require manual handling. After handling the transaction with the "Severe" alert level and lifting the circuit breaker mechanism, the second and third transactions will automatically execute based on the corresponding alert level handling.

### IV. View and Process Transactions
If your transactions trigger KYT verification, you can view all verified transaction information and verification results in the **Custody system** under **KYT Transaction Information**. If a transaction triggers manual review, you can also perform relevant review operations on this page.
