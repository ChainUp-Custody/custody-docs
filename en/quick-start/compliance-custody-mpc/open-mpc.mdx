##  What is KYT
KYT (Know Your Transaction) is a financial regulatory and compliance practice designed to assist financial institutions and other organizations in identifying, monitoring, and reporting on transactions related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities. By monitoring transaction data in real-time or near real-time, KYT aims to identify abnormal or suspicious transaction behavior to ensure the compliance of the financial system. Keysecure supports three industry-leading and well-known KYT service providers. Users can freely choose based on their business needs and cost considerations and can also switch providers during operation.
