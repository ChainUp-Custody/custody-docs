title: Configure KYT Strategy

##  Easily Configure and Automate Your Compliance Strategy

ChainUp Custody collaborates with leading KYT service providers, allowing users to perform real-time transaction monitoring directly from the ChainUp Custody compliance platform.

**Every transaction undergoes comprehensive compliance checks:** Automatically filter transactions based on the compliance strategy rules you set and data from the compliance provider to prevent your team from sending transactions to high-risk address. In addition, the compliance team can freeze inbound transactions from potentially risky addresss to assess compliance before using the funds.

**Customize the Compliance Strategy Engine:** Easily configure transaction rules based on your organization's compliance strategy and integrate risk scores generated by KYT service providers to meet your needs.

**Provide an all-in-one compliance dashboard:** Allow customers to directly manage the policy rules of each KYT service provider through the platform, avoiding the complexity of managing multiple platforms.

<Warning>
Please note that only the MPC workspace administrator can determine KYT strategies!

###  Compliance Assets and Corresponding Strategies
You can determine which cryptocurrencies' deposit and withdrawal transactions need to be monitored by KYT and decide under what conditions KYT verification should be triggered.

<Accordion title="1. Cryptocurrency Quantity Strategy">
When the number of transactions for a particular cryptocurrency is greater than or equal to a certain value, KYT verification is required for that transaction.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="2. Cryptocurrency Value Strategy">
When the transaction value of a particular cryptocurrency is greater than or equal to a certain value (USD), KYT verification is required for that transaction.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Please note that only one of the cryptocurrency quantity strategy and cryptocurrency value strategy can be effective.
</Warning>



###  Compliance Wallets
You can independently decide which wallet addresses need to undergo KYT service monitoring. Regardless of whether the wallet is created manually or through an API and whether it is displayed or hidden, you can select it in the configuration KYT strategy.

###  View and Process Transactions

If your transactions trigger KYT verification and require manual processing, you can view the verification results and perform related operations in **MPC workspace's Transaction Information** or **To-Do**.

Deposit Transactions: If deposit transactions for your wallet require manual review, all co-managers of your wallet can manually confirm them.
<Warning>
Please note that the platform cannot actually block the deposit funds from external high-risk transactions at the blockchain level. The platform fulfills the obligation to notify and requires customers to understand and handle it according to the specific risk information provided by the KYT service provider.
</Warning>

Withdrawal Transactions: If withdrawal transactions for your wallet require manual review, all co-managers of your wallet can manually confirm whether to proceed or reject the transaction. If you approve, the transaction continues; if you reject, the transaction is canceled and will not be broadcast to the signing stage.

<Tip> 
Be sure to complete KYT manual review operations promptly. If a wallet has uncompleted KYT review tasks, the transaction behavior of that wallet will be restricted.
