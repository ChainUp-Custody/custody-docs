## I. Create an Account

If you are using ChainUp Custody's services for the first time, you need to register an account first. Your account can be used for all services. ChainUp Custody supports account registration via mobile number or email.

## II. 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

For the security of your assets, we require you to bind Google Authenticator to verify certain operations using Google verification codes.

<Warning>
If you do not bind 2FA, some features will be restricted.

To fully experience custody services, it is essential to complete KYC2 verification.

You can perform KYC verification through the "My" navigation bar.

Users can be authenticated based on their respective identities: individual or enterprise (different identity requirements for authentication documents).
