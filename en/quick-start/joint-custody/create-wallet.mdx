##  Create a Joint Custody Wallet

Open the [CryptSafe official website](https://www.cryptsafe.sg/zh-CN/login), use the CryptSafe App to scan the QR code for authorization to log in to the CryptSafe system (the app needs to be logged in, and the account must complete KYC2 verification). Click the "Create Wallet" button and fill in the relevant wallet information.

###  Explanation of Wallet Types

### I Personal Wallet
The personal wallet is automatically created when you register a CryptSafe account.

The personal wallet supports KYT packages, financial management, quick buying and selling, flash exchange, and other functions.

### II Corporate Wallet
Created by you as a **self-built wallet**, or a wallet jointly managed by you as a **co-managed wallet**.

<Tip>
If your asset custody method is Compliant Custody, the Enterprise Wallet will display "Isolated Wallet" in the upper right corner. This type of wallet is suitable for [Compliant Custody Services](/quick-start/compliance-custody-joint/open-joint).
