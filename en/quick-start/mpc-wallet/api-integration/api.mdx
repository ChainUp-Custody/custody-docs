##  Overview

ChainUp Custody provides powerful and easy-to-integrate API tools to automate your workflow, quickly create and configure wallets, and receive various wallet-related information.

##  What Can I Do with ChainUp Custody API?

**Automate Wallet Management Workflow**

Efficiently and conveniently create and name wallets in bulk using the API, automating the wallet management process.

**Automate Transaction Workflow**

Batch process blockchain transactions, automate asset transfers, and automatically sign transactions using the secure API Co-Signer.

**Expand Wallet and Address Creation**

Configure multiple wallets quickly and cost-effectively. This is useful for game studios, NFT service providers, or developers building DApps to easily manage a large number of digital assets.

**Quickly View Transaction Information**

Quickly retrieve wallet address information and transaction details, allowing users to easily access a complete record of transactions and details to monitor their digital assets conveniently.

##  API Configuration

You can easily configure the API information for the MPC System on the Custody Web version for more flexible wallet management.

<Warning>
**Important Note**

An MPC Workspace can only configure one API. To ensure the functionality of the API, API configuration needs to be synchronized with Co-Signer configuration.

All users in the workspace can manage the API functions. Any addition or modification of API information requires approval through the workspace strategy before it can take effect.

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on effective API integration: [API Documentation](/api-references/intro/custody-apis).

By configuring the API information for the MPC System, you will be able to use API features more conveniently, enabling more flexible and efficient digital asset management.
</Warning>

###  API Management

In the Custody PC(Web) version, use the "**API Management**."


Create or edit API information in the MPC system and wait for the workspace strategy approval to complete.

<Tip>
Enabling or disabling the API does not require approval.

###  Configuration Fields

You need to provide the following information to complete API configuration:

**Bind IP Address**

This field is used to specify the IP address on which the API interface listens. Binding a specific IP address enhances system security, allowing requests only from a specific IP range.

**Transaction Status Notification Address**

Used to receive transaction status notifications at the specified URL. When a transaction status change occurs, the system will send a notification to this address to ensure timely updates on the latest transaction status.

**Co-Signer Interface Address**

Specify the API interface address of the Co-Signer service. Co-Signer is a service for implementing automatic asset aggregation. Configuring the correct interface address ensures the normal invocation of Co-Signer services.

**Co-Signer RSA Public Key**

Provide the RSA public key for the Co-Signer service, used for encrypting and decrypting related data. Ensuring the correct RSA public key helps maintain communication security.

**Client System RSA Public Key**

The RSA public key of the client system, used for encrypting sensitive information and ensuring that only the client system can decrypt it. Providing the correct RSA public key helps protect data security during the communication process.

**Remarks**

Provide additional configuration instructions or labels. This field is usually used to record additional information related to API configuration, making it easy for admins and developers to understand special requirements or agreements associated with the configuration.
