title: Co-Signer Configuration
---

## I. Overview

This document will introduce the functionality of Co-Signer and how to configure Co-Signer to meet the client's business requirements. In the ChainUp Custody ecosystem, Co-Signer serves not only as a security measure but also as a key factor in promoting decentralization and trust, aiming to provide users with a more secure, transparent, and efficient digital experience.

## II. What is Co-Signer?

In the field of blockchain or digital assets, "Co-Signer" usually refers to a mechanism where multiple individuals or entities need to jointly sign a transaction or contract. This mechanism is primarily used to enhance the security and credibility of transactions or contracts. The purpose of using Co-Signer is to ensure that critical operations require confirmation and authorization from multiple parties, thereby reducing potential risks and increasing overall security. This is particularly crucial for high-value transactions or critical business operations in digital assets and blockchain networks.

## III. Role of Co-Signer

**Secure Digital Asset Management**

In the digital asset domain, Co-Signer is employed to safeguard high-value digital assets. A multi-signature wallet ensures that private keys are distributed in different locations, preventing a single private key from being compromised or misused.

**Smart Contract Operations**

For smart contracts that require multi-party confirmation, Co-Signer provides a secure mechanism. For instance, distributed applications (DApps) may require multiple participants to jointly sign for executing sensitive operations.

**Transaction Security**

For transactions on the blockchain, especially those involving substantial funds, multi-signature functionality enhances transaction security. Even if one account is compromised, it is insufficient to complete the transaction.

**Enterprise-level Applications**

In enterprise-level blockchain applications, Co-Signer is used to ensure that multiple authorized entities must agree on specific decisions or transactions to meet compliance and auditing requirements.

## IV. Deploying Co-Signer

        <Warning>
        **Important**

         1. The value of exe in the configuration file: co-signer-sgx. If the executable program name is modified, the value of exe needs to be modified to a custom name.

         2. The configuration file stipulates that co-signer can only run in the directory /data/co-signer/. If you need to customize the running directory, please change **all** /data/co-signer/ in the configuration to custom Define directory

         3. Heap memory, the recommended **heapSize** configuration is: 6G (6144)

        </Warning>
        ```json
        {
            "exe": "mpc-co-signer",
            "key": "private.pem",
            "debug": false,

#### Run Co-Signer

To view the help for the executable program: `co-signer -h`, the result is as follows:

```sh
v1.1.0

Usage: co-signer [-hv] [-server] [-rsa-gen] [-recover-seed mnemonic] [-rsa-pri-import rsa private key] [-verify-sign-pub-import develop rsa public key to verify unsign transaction] [-keystore-gen] [-custody
-pub-import]

Options:
    -custody-pub-import string
            import custody public key
    -h this is help
    -keystore-gen
            Used to merge files (including seed.dat, rsaPri.pem, etc.) to generate a new keystore.json file
    -recover-seed string
            recover seed by mnemonic, use '-' between each word
    -rsa-gen
            generate rsa pem by tools
    -rsa-pri-import string
            import current rsa private key
    -server
            start co-signer otherwise only tools
    -v this is version
    -verify-sign-pub-import string
            import the public key used for verifying sign


## Explanation
1. -v                         Get the version number of co-signer
2. -server                    Start the co-signer parameter. If this parameter is not used during startup, it is in tool mode.
3. -conf                      Specify the configuration file when starting co-signer, default: ./conf/config.yaml
4. -rsa-gen                   Tool mode: Enter the startup password, generate an encrypted private key and an unencrypted public key, and generate it to the keystore.json file.
5. -rsa-pri-import            Tool mode: Enter the startup password, import the existing rsa private key, generate the encrypted rsa private key file (import only the private key), and generate it to the keystore.json file.
6. -verify-sign-pub-import    Import the public key used to verify the sign of the customer (sign), and generate it to the keystore.json file. After importing, co-signer will verify the withdrawal and web3 customer sign (sign), and the sign generation method is detailed in the API documentation.
7. -custody-pub-import        Tool mode: Enter the startup password, import the public key of custody, and generate it to the keystore.json file.
8. -keystore-gen              Tool mode: Used to unify import files such as seed.dat, rsaPri.pem, rsaPub.pem in v1.0.x version into the keystore.json file.
```


**Add Configuration and Start Co-Signer**

<Steps>

    <Step title="Create a folder in the same directory as the executable program">
        ```sh
        mkdir conf
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a configuration file in the conf directory, file name: config.yaml">
        Configuration file content is as follows:
        ```yaml
        ## Main configuration information
        main:
            ## Co-signer service IP address
            tcp: "0.0.0.0:28888"
            ## Encrypted storage file used by v1.1.x version
            keystore_file: "conf/keystore.json"

        ## Custody system
        custody_service:
            ## app_id, obtained after creating a merchant
            app_id: ""
            ## API domain address, see the interface documentation
            domain: ""
            ## Request and response language, supporting zh_CN and en_US
            language: "zh_CN"

        ## Customer system
        custom_service:
            ## Withdrawal signature callback address, when not configured, sign needs to be verified forcefully
            withdraw_callback_url: ""
            ## Web3 transaction signature callback address, when not configured, sign needs to be verified forcefully
            web3_callback_url: ""
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure the Rsa private key used by Co-Signer">
     **Method One** 

        Execute the command and enter the password as prompted. The password is the same as the one used for the wallet seed configuration! After successful execution, a file named keystore.json is generated in the conf directory.

        The private key is used to encrypt request parameters when requesting the Custody service. The corresponding public key of the private key needs to be configured to Custody. Custody uses this public key to decrypt Co-Signer request data.

        ```sh
        ./co-signer -rsa-gen
        ```

     **Method Two**

        Execute the command and enter the password as prompted. The password is the same as the one used for the wallet seed configuration! After successful execution, a file named keystore.json is generated in the conf directory.

        The private key is used to encrypt request parameters when requesting the Custody service. The corresponding public key of the private key needs to be configured to Custody. Custody uses this public key to decrypt Co-Signer request data.

        ```sh
        ./co-signer -rsa-pri-import 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
  ```
</Step>
     <Step title="Co-Signer configures Custody public key">
         After executing the command, enter the password as prompted. The password is consistent with the password used to configure the wallet seed! After successful execution, a file is generated in the conf directory: keystore.json

         The public key is provided by Custody, and Co-Signer uses the public key to decrypt the data returned by the Custody service.

         ```sh
         ./co-signer -custody-pub-import 'Cusotdy RSA Public key'
         ```
     </Step>
     <Step title="Co-Signer configures the public key used to verify the signature when not calling back to the client system">
         After executing the command, enter the password as prompted. The password is consistent with the password used to configure the wallet seed! After successful execution, a file is generated in the conf directory: keystore.json

         After importing, Co-Signer will verify the withdrawal and web3 transaction signatures (sign). Please refer to the API documentation for the sign generation method.

         ```sh
         ./co-signer -verify-sign-pub-import 'RSA Public key'
         ```
     </Step>
</Steps>


- **Startup shell script example**

Start Co-Signer. It is recommended to use a shell script to start (to avoid password leakage to the terminal)

```sh
#!/bin/bash -e

project_path=$(
    cd $(dirname $0)
    pwd
)

STR_PASSWORD=""
echo -n "Please enter your password:"
stty -echo
read STR_PASSWORD
stty echo


if [[ ! -n "$STR_PASSWORD" ]]; then
    echo "Password cannot be null"
    exit 1
fi

echo ""
echo "Startup Program..."
echo ""

# start
echo ${STR_PASSWORD} | nohup ${project_path}/co-signer -server >>nohup.nout 2>&1 &
```

## V. Add Co-Signer Server to Whitelist
ChainUp Custody needs to access Co-Signer to create equi-weight private keys and generate addresses. Therefore, you need to add the ChainUp Custody server IP to the security group or whitelist of the Co-Signer's startup port. The Custody server IP is as follows:

1. Allow the Custody server (IP: 54.254.7.206) to access the 28888 port on the Co-Signer server. Note that the 28888 port is the listening port of the Co-Signer program and can be customized.

2. The Co-Signer server needs to access the Custody server, and permission to access 54.251.87.91:433 needs to be granted.
