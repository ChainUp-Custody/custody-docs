title: Create MPC Wallet
---

## I. Introduction

The MPC wallet consists of two types: the **main wallet** and **sub-wallets**.

A main wallet can create **multiple sub-wallets**.

### I.I. Use Cases

1. The main wallet can be used for asset statistics for a specific business line, and sub-wallets can be allocated to **different users**.

2. The main wallet can be used for the overall asset statistics of a company, and sub-wallets can be allocated to **different business departments**.

## II. Create Main Wallet

After logging into the Custody App and switching to the MPC system, you can create an MPC main wallet based on your business needs.

<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <CardGroup cols={3}>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc1.png" width="200"/>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc2.png" width="200"/>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc3.png" width="200"/>
    </CardGroup>
</div>

<Note>
When you create an MPC main wallet, the system will automatically create an associated sub-wallet of type Web3.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations:**

- Design the main wallet name carefully. For differentiation of wallet purposes and convenient team management, the wallet name cannot be changed after creation.
  
- If the default wallet configuration does not meet your requirements, you can contact your account manager or email for support (custody@chainup.com).

- The private key password is crucial for encrypting and decrypting private key shares. Please manage it carefully.
</Warning>

## III. Create Sub-Wallet

After creating the MPC main wallet and completing the backup of private key shares, you can proceed to create sub-wallets under the MPC main wallet.

<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <CardGroup cols={3}>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc4.png" width="200"/>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc5.png" width="200"/>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc6.png" width="200"/>
    </CardGroup>
</div>
