title: Create MPC System
---

##  Introduction

The MPC System consists of two types: the **Workspace** and **wallets**.

A workspace can create **multiple wallets**.

###  Use Cases

1. The workspace can be used for asset statistics for a specific business line, and wallets can be allocated to **different users**.

2. The workspace can be used for the overall asset statistics of a company, and wallets can be allocated to **different business departments**.

##  Create Workspace

After logging into the Custody App and switching to the MPC system, you can create an MPC Workspace based on your business needs.

<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <CardGroup cols={3}>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc1.png" width="200"/>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc2.png" width="200"/>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc3.png" width="200"/>
    </CardGroup>
</div>

<Note>
When you create an MPC Workspace, the system will automatically create an associated wallet of type Web3.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations:**

- Design the workspace name carefully. For differentiation of wallet purposes and convenient team management, the wallet name cannot be changed after creation.
  
- If the default wallet configuration does not meet your requirements, you can contact your account manager or email for support (custody@chainup.com).

- The private key password is crucial for encrypting and decrypting private key shares. Please manage it carefully.
</Warning>

##  Create wallet

After creating the MPC workspace and completing the backup of private key shares, you can proceed to create wallets under the MPC workspace.

<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <CardGroup cols={3}>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc4.png" width="200"/>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc5.png" width="200"/>
        <img src="/images/quickstart/mpc6.png" width="200"/>
    </CardGroup>
</div>
