## I. Introduction

The MPC wallet comprises **three private key shares**, with two encrypted shares stored on **Microsoft Cloud Services** and **Amazon Cloud Services**, and the other stored on your **local device**. To ensure the security of your assets, it is essential to timely backup the locally stored private key share and keep it secure. These private key shares exist in the form of a **recovery phrase**, making them easy to remember.

There are two backup options for private key shares: **local backup** and **cloud backup**.

<Warning>
To ensure the security of your assets, please make sure to backup your private key shares promptly. Wallet functions that are not backed up will be restricted.
