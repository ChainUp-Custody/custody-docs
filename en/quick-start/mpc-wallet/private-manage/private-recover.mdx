title: Private Key Recovery
---

## I. Introduction

The ChainUp Custody MPC Wallet is a wallet designed to protect user privacy and security. It employs multiple private key shares, dispersed across multiple devices through key sharing, enhancing the wallet's security. The private key recovery feature plays a crucial role in the MPC wallet, allowing users to recover their wallet in case of device loss or damage.

<Note>
For asset security, private key shares are strongly tied to the account. This means that the loss of both your private key shares and the account would impact your assets.
</Note>

Private key recovery supports two methods: **manual recovery** and **cloud recovery**.

## II. Manual Recovery

Input the private key shares (recovery phrase) manually stored in a secure offline environment to complete the recovery.

## III. Cloud Recovery

Automatically download the encrypted private key shares file backed up to the cloud onto the local device to complete the recovery (the encrypted private key file needs to be decrypted with the private key password).
