##  Function Introduction

Google Authenticator is a tool that provides two-factor authentication by generating one-time passwords to enhance account security. Once the Google Authenticator is bound, you will need to enter a dynamic six-digit verification code generated by the Google Authenticator when performing sensitive operations.


##  Operation Procedure

To ensure the security of your assets, we require you to bind the Google Authenticator so that you can use the Google verification code when performing key operations.
