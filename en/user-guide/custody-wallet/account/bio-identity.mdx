title: Biometric Verification
---

##  Function Introduction

Biometric technology is a type of physical characteristic recognition technology that verifies identity by recognizing personal biological characteristics. Because biological characteristics are unique and difficult to fabricate or duplicate, they are more secure than traditional passwords or PIN codes. The CryptoSafe App allows users to enable biometric verification for password-free payments or operations, and verification can be completed using their own biological characteristics. This reduces the hassle of entering passwords or GA verification codes, making user operations simpler and smoother.

However, while biometric technology brings many conveniences, it also involves considerations of privacy and security. Please consider all factors when deciding whether to enable biometric verification.
