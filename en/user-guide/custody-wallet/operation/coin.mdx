## I. Function Introduction

The Coin Management module is used to display the native tokens used by the mainnet supported by the system and the native tokens (including other coins) that users have already activated. It also provides the feature to manage the activated coins. Users can view the operational information of the coin, including whether the coin is enabled, whether it supports deposits and withdrawals, and perform related operations.

## III. Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Why can't I enable, deposit, or withdraw operations in coin operational information?">
The system will close related operations at certain times (such as during network forks, upgrades, system maintenance, etc.), so users may not be able to perform operations like enabling, depositing, and withdrawing. In this case, users need to wait for the system to be enabled again before performing the corresponding operations.
