## III. Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Why can't I enable, deposit, or withdraw operations in coin operational information?">
The system will close related operations at certain times (such as during network forks, upgrades, system maintenance, etc.), so you may not be able to perform operations like enabling, depositing, and withdrawing. In this case, you need to wait for the system to be enabled again before performing the corresponding operations.
