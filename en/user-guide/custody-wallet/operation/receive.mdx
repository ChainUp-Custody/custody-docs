## III. Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="What to do if the deposit is successful but the balance account is not credited?">
- 1. To ensure the safety of funds, the account needs to reach a certain number of confirmations after the deposit before it can be credited (you can query the number of confirmations in the blockchain explorer). If it still hasn't been credited after reaching the required confirmations, you can contact customer service.
- 2. Due to the uniqueness of some coins (such as EOS), all user deposit addresses are the same, and the system uses memo to distinguish. For deposits of this coin, you need to confirm whether the memo you entered is correct.
