## III. Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="What to do if the deposit is successful but the balance account is not credited?">
- 1. To ensure the security of funds, the account needs to reach the confirmation number before it can be credited after deposit (you can check the confirmation number on the blockchain explorer); if it still has not been credited after reaching the confirmation number, you can contact customer service for processing.
- 2. Due to the uniqueness of some coins (such as EOS), all the addresses you deposit to are the same, and the system uses memo to distinguish. For this type of coin deposit, you need to confirm whether the memo you entered is correct.
