## III. Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Why can't I perform deposit and withdrawal operations?">
It may be that the system closes related operations at certain times (such as during blockchain forks, upgrades, system maintenance, etc.), so you cannot perform them. Please wait for the system to enable them before operating.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to add a whitelist address?">
Only the wallet owner has the right to add whitelist addresses. Please contact the wallet owner for related operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to solve the problem of delayed withdrawal arrival?">
If the withdrawal is delayed, please confirm whether the required number of block confirmations has been met. If the number of block confirmations does not meet the requirements, your assets may not be able to arrive temporarily and you need to check again after the confirmation count is reached.
