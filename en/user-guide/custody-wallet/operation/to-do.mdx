## I. Function Introduction

In the ChainUp Custody Wallet, you can view and handle pending tasks related to your account.

The type of your pending tasks will depend on your account role in the selected main wallet.
- **Administrator/Wallet Creator**: The member who creates the wallet is the default wallet administrator, with all wallet permissions;
- **Approval Member**: Administrators automatically become approval members after adding ordinary members to the approval policy, with permissions to initiate receipts, transfers, approvals, etc.;
- **Ordinary Member**: Members added to the wallet by the administrator are default ordinary members; they have basic permissions to initiate receipts, transfers, etc.
