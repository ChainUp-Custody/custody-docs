## I. Function Introduction

In the Keysecure Wallet, you can view and handle transaction approvals related to you.

Your type of transaction approval will depend on your role in the wallet.
- **admin/Wallet owner**: The member who creates the wallet is by default the wallet admin and has all permissions of the wallet.
- **Approval Member**: admins automatically become approval members after adding ordinary members to the approval strategy, having the permissions to initiate collections, transfers, approvals, etc.
- **Ordinary Member**: Members added to the wallet by the admin are by default ordinary members; they have basic permissions such as initiating collections and transfers.
