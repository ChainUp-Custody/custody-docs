## I. Function Introduction

In the ChainUp Custody Wallet, you can view and handle transaction approvals related to you.

Your type of transaction approval will depend on your role in the wallet.
- **Administrator/Wallet Creator**: The member who creates the wallet is by default the wallet administrator and has all permissions of the wallet.
- **Approval Member**: Administrators automatically become approval members after adding ordinary members to the approval strategy, having the permissions to initiate collections, transfers, approvals, etc.
- **Ordinary Member**: Members added to the wallet by the administrator are by default ordinary members; they have basic permissions such as initiating collections and transfers.
