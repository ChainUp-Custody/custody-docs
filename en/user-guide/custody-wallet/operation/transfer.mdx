## I. Function Introduction

The withdrawal function allows users to transfer digital assets from their wallet account to an external address. This guide only explains page withdrawals, for API withdrawals, please refer to the API documentation link.

In the enterprise wallet, for the sake of fund security and efficient approval, it is recommended to add an outflow strategy for valuable coins to ensure the safety and compliance of funds. The transfer process may differ depending on the role of the wallet members.
