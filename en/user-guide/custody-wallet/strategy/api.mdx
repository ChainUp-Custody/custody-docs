## I. Function Introduction

ChainUp Custody provides users with powerful and easy-to-integrate API tools, which can help you automate workflows, quickly create and configure wallets, and receive information about various aspects of the wallet. Whether it's automating wallet management, transaction processes, or quickly viewing transaction information, it can be achieved through the API.

<Warning>
Only the wallet owner can configure API information, and editing and modifying information requires GA verification. Please refer to the [API Interface Document](api-references/custody-apis/apis/description) to learn more about how to effectively interface with the API.

<Step title="API Information Input">
    Only the wallet owner has the permission to view and operate the API management page. On the API management page, you can enter the following API-related information:

    - **Trusted IP**: The IP address of the third-party server. It must be added to communicate with the Custody server normally, otherwise, even if you get the API information, you cannot use it.
    - **Callback Address**: Some businesses cannot provide real-time feedback results. This is the address where the system will notify the processing results to the third-party server after subsequent processing is completed.
    - **Second Confirmation Address**: The withdrawal business second confirmation address. After the API initiates a withdrawal request, the system will request confirmation from this address to further enhance fund security.
