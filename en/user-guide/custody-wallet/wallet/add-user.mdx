title: Adding Co-managed Wallet Members
---

## I. Function Introduction

<Note>Only the wallet administrator can add/delete wallet members.</Note>
In the Custody Wallet, you can add new users and assign them different roles. Currently, the system has three types of roles:

- **Administrator/Wallet Creator**: The member who creates the wallet is the default wallet administrator and has all wallet permissions;
- **Approval Members**: Administrators automatically become approval members after adding ordinary members to the approval strategy, and they have the authority to initiate receipts, transfers, approvals, etc.;
- **Ordinary Members**: Members added to the wallet by the administrator are default ordinary members; they have basic permissions such as initiating receipts and transfers;


<Tip>
**To become a custody member, you must meet:**
1. Have a ChainUp Custody account
2. Need to complete KYC certification
3. Bind and turn on Google Authenticator

**Inviting ordinary custody members to note:**
When ordinary members join the transaction approval flow, the member is automatically upgraded to an approver. Adding a transaction approval flow can refer to [Security Strategy](/user-guide/custody-wallet/strategy/transfer).
