title: Adding Wallet Members
---

## I. Function Introduction

<Note>Only the wallet admin can add/delete wallet members.</Note>
In the Custody Wallet, you can add new users and assign them different roles. Currently, the system has three types of roles:

- **admin/Wallet owner**: The member who creates the wallet is the default wallet admin and has all wallet permissions;
- **Approval Members**: admins automatically become approval members after adding ordinary members to the approval strategy, and they have the authority to initiate receipts, transfers, approvals, etc.;
- **Ordinary Members**: Members added to the wallet by the admin are default ordinary members; they have basic permissions such as initiating receipts and transfers;


<Tip>
**To become a custody member, you must meet:**
1. Have a CryptSafe account
2. Need to complete KYC certification
3. Bind and turn on Google Authenticator

**Inviting ordinary custody members to note:**
