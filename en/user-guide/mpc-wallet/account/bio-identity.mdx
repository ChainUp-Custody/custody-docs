title: Biometric Verification
---

##  Function Introduction

Biometric technology is a type of physical characteristic recognition technology that verifies identity by recognizing personal biological characteristics. Because biological characteristics are unique and difficult to fabricate or duplicate, they are more secure than traditional passwords or PIN codes. The Custody App allows users to enable biometric verification for password-free payments or operations, and verification can be completed using their own biological characteristics. This reduces the hassle of entering passwords or GA verification codes, making user operations simpler and smoother.

However, while biometric technology brings many conveniences, it also involves considerations of privacy and security. Please consider all factors when deciding whether to enable biometric verification for MPC system operations.

<Step title="Enable Biometric Verification for Different Scenarios">

#### A. Password-free Operations

Enablement requires GA (Google Authenticator) verification.

<tip>
In this mode, you can use biometric verification as a substitute for Google Authenticator. Relevant scenarios include initiating transfers, approving transactions, managing team members, etc.
</tip>

#### B. Password-free Payments

    Enable at the workspace level;
    Enablement requires private key password verification;
<tip>
    If other workspaces use the same private key password, you can choose to enable the password-free payment function for these wallets at the same time.

##  Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Why can't I enable biometric Verification?">
Please note that the following situations may prevent you from enabling biometric verification:
1. The local device's biometric function is not authorized for the Custody App.
2. The local device has not enabled the biometric function, so the app cannot read the biometric information.
3. The wallet does not store the private key locally.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is biometric verification invalid or unusable?">
Situations where the biometric verification function automatically shuts down or becomes unusable:
1. The local private key has been modified, for example, the password has been changed or re-backed up.
2. The local device's biometric information has been modified, for example, a new face or fingerprint has been added.
