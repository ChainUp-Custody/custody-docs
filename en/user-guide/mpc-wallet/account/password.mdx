title: Setting Login Password
---

## I. Function Introduction

In Custody, you can set a login password for your account to enhance security. The login password should meet the following rules:
1. Composed of numbers, English letters, or special symbols,
2. Contains at least two types of uppercase letters, numbers, or special symbols,
3. No less than 8 characters in length.

After setting the password, you can log in or switch accounts through password and verification code dual-factor authentication to ensure the security of identity verification. The password setting for each account is independent, and changing the password of one account will not affect other accounts.

<Note>
If:
1. You are using a mobile phone number or email to log in to your account and have not yet completed the password setting,
2. You have logged in with an old password for more than 60 days,
The system will provide page guidance during the login process, and you can choose to skip the password setting.
</Note>
