<Warning>
**Important Note**
Each MPC main wallet can only configure one API. To ensure the effectiveness of the API function, the API configuration needs to be synchronized with the Co-Signer configuration. Only the wallet creator can configure the API information, and editing and modifying the information requires GA verification. Please refer to the [API documentation](/api-references/intro/custody-apis) for a detailed understanding of how to effectively dock the API.
