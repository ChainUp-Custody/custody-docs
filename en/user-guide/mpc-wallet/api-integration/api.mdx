<Warning>
**Important Note**
Each MPC workspace can only configure one API. To ensure the effectiveness of the API function, the API configuration needs to be synchronized with the Co-Signer configuration. Only the workspace owner can configure the API information, and editing and modifying the information requires GA verification. Please refer to the [API documentation](/api-references/intro/custody-apis) for a detailed understanding of how to effectively dock the API.
</Warning>

</Step>


<Step title="API Field Filling">
Please fill in the API information and submit a new API request. The API will only become effective after approval from the workspace strategy approver.

* **IP Address:** Specifies the IP address that the API interface listens to, allowing requests only from a specific IP range.

* **Notification Address:** The URL address used to receive transaction status notifications.

* **Co-Signer Interface Address:** Specifies the API interface address of the Co-Signer service, ensuring the normal invocation of the Co-Signer service.

* **Co-Signer RSA Public Key:** Used for encrypting and decrypting related data. Ensuring the correct RSA public key helps maintain communication security.

* **Client System RSA Public Key:** Used to encrypt sensitive information and ensure that only the client system can decrypt it. Providing the correct RSA public key helps protect data security during communication.

* **Remarks:** Records additional information related to API configuration, facilitating the understanding of special requirements or agreements by administrators and developers.
