**Tips**
1. The equal-rights private key share is encrypted and saved using the public key uploaded with the corresponding APPID.
2. When the private key share of the Co-Signer server is leaked or lost, a new equal-rights private key share can be generated through the refresh function, and the original equal-rights private key share cannot be used.
3. When the Co-Signer server is temporarily not in use, the private key share of the corresponding APPID can be deleted.
</Warning>

## III. Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="What is a Co-Signer?">
In the field of blockchain or digital assets, a `"Co-Signer"` usually refers to a mechanism where multiple individuals or entities need to jointly sign a transaction or contract. This mechanism is mainly used to enhance the security and credibility of the transaction or contract. The purpose of using a Co-Signer is to ensure that when it comes to key operations, multiple parties' confirmation and authorization are required, thereby reducing potential risks and increasing overall security. This is especially important for high-value transactions or key business operations in digital assets and blockchain networks.

<Accordion title="What does a Co-Signer do?">
A Co-Signer plays an important role in the following aspects:
- **Secure Digital Asset Management**: The Co-Signer is used to protect high-value digital assets. Multisignature wallets ensure that private keys are distributed in different places to prevent a single private key from being leaked or misused.
- **Smart Contract Operations**: For smart contracts that require confirmation from multiple parties, the Co-Signer provides a secure mechanism.
- **Transaction Security**: For transactions on the blockchain, especially those involving large amounts of funds, multisignature enhances the security of the transaction.
- **Enterprise-level Applications**: In enterprise-level blockchain applications, the Co-Signer is used to ensure that multiple authorized entities must agree to a specific decision or transaction.
