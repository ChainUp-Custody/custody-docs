title: Asset Flow strategy
---



## Function Overview

Users can view all active asset flow strategies under the current workspace's cold wallet plan and make adjustments—such as adding, modifying, or deleting strategies—according to their business needs.

Asset flow strategies help maintain a dynamic balance of funds between hot, warm, and cold wallets, ensuring both security and regulatory compliance. Typically, hot wallets are best for daily transactions and trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, especially for beginners. While hot wallets offer the convenience of quick transactions and multi-device access, they are less secure and more susceptible to online threats.

On the other hand, cold wallets are more suitable for long-term, secure storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency. Therefore, it's recommended to keep a small portion of funds in hot wallets for day-to-day operations and store the majority in cold wallets to mitigate risks and enhance security.

* **Hot to Warm：** Define the maximum risk exposure of funds in the hot wallet under various conditions. Users can set the maximum asset percentage for the hot wallet and choose how total assets are tracked (either real-time data or averages) to establish the storage rules. Also, configure a minimum transfer amount to the warm wallet to avoid frequent small transfers.

* **Warm to Hot：** Move funds from the warm wallet to the hot wallet to ensure enough liquidity for daily operations and improve fund utilization. Users can determine the transfer amount based on average transaction values and set a minimum transfer amount to prevent frequent small transfers.

* **Warm to Cold：** Transfer surplus assets from the warm wallet to the cold wallet for secure long-term storage. Users can set the maximum asset percentage for the warm wallet and choose how total assets are tracked (either real-time data or averages) to establish the storage rules. Additionally, configure a minimum transfer amount to the warm wallet to avoid frequent small transfers.
