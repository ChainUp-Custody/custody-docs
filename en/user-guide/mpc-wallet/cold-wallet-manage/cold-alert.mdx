title: Monitor and Warn
---


## Feature Overview

The Custody system supports monitoring the following operational scenarios for cold wallet functions:

1. Balance Monitoring
Proposal transactions initiated by vote-free addresses do not require signer approval and are automatically passed. Since these transactions require the vote-free address to pay gas fees, it is necessary to maintain a certain amount of the native crypto coin. Insufficient native coin balance will cause transaction failure, affecting the automated scheduling of assets. The Custody system monitors the balance of vote-free addresses on the warm wallet based on the user's configured contract network. If the balance falls below the threshold, an alert is triggered.
<Tip> 
If users want to enable balance monitoring, they need to configure the monitoring scope and threshold according to their requirements.

## Asset Transfer Task Monitoring
The Custody system monitors the status of warm-to-hot and hot-to-warm transfer tasks and notifies users of key events.

Key events include:
* **Cold Wallet System Task Initiation Notification:** The system automatically initiates warm-to-hot, warm-to-cold, and hot-to-warm transfer tasks.

* **Cold Wallet System Task Exception Notification:** Task not completed within a reasonable time.

* **Cold Wallet System Task Initiation Failure Notification:** Insufficient balance in the hot and warm wallets to cover the transfer amount.

* **Cold Wallet System Task Failure Notification:** Transaction failed due to insufficient gas fees, or transaction was rejected.

* **Cold Wallet System Task Success Notification:** The system successfully completed the scheduled task.
