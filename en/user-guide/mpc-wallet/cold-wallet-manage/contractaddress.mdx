<Step title="Obtain and Add Vote-Free Address to Warm Contract">
   After approval, you will be able to view the contract address information and obtain the corresponding vote-free address for the contract in the [Contract Address] list.

   <Note>
   The vote-free address is automatically assigned by Custody to each workspace. To achieve automated transfers, you need to add the vote-free address to the warm contract. Transactions initiated by this address will be successfully completed without the consent of the signers.
