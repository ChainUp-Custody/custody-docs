title: Configure Auto Sweeping Rules
---
<Tip> 
It is strongly recommended not to configure the same asset strategy for both the Sweep ERC-20 Tokens feature and the Sweep All Coins feature simultaneously. If an error occurs, the system will execute the sweeping operation configured earliest based on the time of your operation.
</Tip>

##  Function Introduction
After the user completes the configuration of the auto sweeping rules, the Custody system will execute the corresponding sweeping operations according to the prescribed auto sweep strategy. This will cause the assets on the wallet/address within the applied scope to be transferred uniformly to the preset omnibus wallet address. If the wallet being swept (withdrawal address) lacks miner fees, the gas station will recharge the main chain coin for this wallet according to the set gas strategy.

<Note> 
### Preconditions for Using the Function

Please ensure that the main wallet has not expired. The expiration situation will cause all wallet-related business functions to be unusable.

Ensure that the API and Co-Signer configuration has been completed to ensure the normal operation of the API, so that the sweeping function can be smoothly executed.

Please upgrade the App version to **6.4.5** and above.
</Note>

   <Tip>
   Please note:
   The omnibus wallet and gas station can be included from the appkied scope of auto sweeping.

   </Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Configure Auto Sweeping Strategy">
   Configuring the auto sweeping strategy is a key step, which involves deciding which currencies will be swept, the sweeping threshold, and other related conditions.

</div>

 <Tip>
   If you sweep the main coin, be sure to carefully fill in the sweeping threshold and the supplement number of the auto fueling strategy. It is recommended that the number of sweeping threshold should be greater than the supplement amount of auto fueling strategy to ensure not cause operational problems.
 </Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Configure Auto Fueling Strategy">
The auto fueling strategy will decide under what circumstances the gas station will supplement miner fees to the sub-wallet to support auto sweep feature.
<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">

</div>
 <Tip>
Co-managers can create strategies in the dimension of the main chain coin, that is, when the swept coins lacks the miner fees, how much the gas station needs to supplement the main chain coin.

The newly created auto fueling strategy is turned on by default. After successful creation, you can edit, delete, and close the gas strategy, and support batch processing.
</Tip>

</Step>


<Step title="Configure Notification">

If your auto sweeping orders lack the required miners fee main chain coin, the Custody system will send you a notification to ensure that you understand and take necessary actions in time. Once the system detects that the auto sweeping orders lacks the required miners fee, it will send a reminder to the set notification.

<Warning>

**Key Steps and Precautions**
