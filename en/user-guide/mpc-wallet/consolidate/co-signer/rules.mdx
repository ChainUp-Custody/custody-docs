title: Configuring Auto Sweep Rules
---

## I. Function Introduction
Once users have configured auto-sweep rules, the Custody system will execute corresponding sweeping operations according to the specified sweeping strategy. This will result in assets from general addresses meeting the auto-sweep conditions being transferred to the Omnibus Wallet. In cases where a general address meets the auto-sweep conditions but lacks gas fees, funds will be transferred from the Gas Station address to the general address.

<Note> 
### Prerequisites for Using the Feature

Please ensure that the workstation is not expired, as expiration will render all wallet-related business functions unusable.

Ensure that API and Co-Signer configurations are completed to ensure the normal operation of the API, thereby enabling the auto-sweep function to execute smoothly.

Please upgrade the App version to **6.4.5** or higher.
</Note>


## II. Operation Procedure

   <Warning>
   **Important Note**

   Omnibus Wallets and the Gas Station can be included in the sweeping scope.

   If your wallet has multiple addresses with assets that need to be swept, all assets of the wallet's addresses will be included in the sweeping scope.
   </Warning>

</Step>
<Step title="Sweeping Strategy">


  The sweeping strategy is automatically generated and enabled. The sweeping strategy may encounter anomalies:
  
  1. The Omnibus Wallet is not configured 
  
  2. The Omnibus Wallet has not generated addresses
  
  3. The Omnibus Wallet addresses are not encrypted, requiring signature by the workstation creator or administrator even after the strategy is enabled

  4. Insufficient gas fees

  The Omnibus Wallet's list of sweeping destination addresses can be viewed for each address's status. Administrators and creators can handle situations where addresses are not generated or encrypted with a single click.

</div>


<Tips>
If a wallet fails to initiate a sweeping transfer due to insufficient gas fees, the Gas Station will be responsible for replenishing the gas fees for the corresponding wallet. The replenishment amount will be determined based on the estimated sweeping order itself.
</Tips>

</Step>



<Step title="Configuring Notification">

Once the system detects:

1. Lack of network's native token for sweeping, and/or

2. The Omnibus Wallet lacks addresses: The Omnibus Wallet has not generated encrypted sweeping network addresses, resulting in assets being unable to be successfully swept

Reminder emails will be sent to the set notification email address to ensure that you are promptly informed and can take necessary actions.
