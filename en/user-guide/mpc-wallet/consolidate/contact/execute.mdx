title: Executing Contract Consolidation
---

<Tip>
Please note that only authorized sub-wallets and consolidated assets can execute contract consolidation operations.
</Tip>

## I. Function Introduction
The contract consolidation feature of ChainUp Custody refers to the creation of smart contracts to **consolidate** digital assets scattered across different wallets into a specific wallet address. By consolidating small assets, it can significantly reduce the overall transaction costs, improve user transfer experience, and reduce the complexity of managing custody funds.

This document will introduce how to execute contract consolidation, in order to orderly consolidate assets scattered in different wallets to the designated wallet address. Before performing the following steps, please ensure that you have fully configured the contract rules and completed the corresponding authorization work.

Assuming your wallet assets have reached the contract consolidation strategy threshold, you can consolidate the assets to the set wallet address in two ways:

**Manual Consolidation** or **Automatic Consolidation**.

## II. Operation Procedure

### Manual Consolidation

Through the Custody APP, you can manually call the consolidation address to execute contract consolidation. This method provides the flexibility of user active control.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Precautions**

- If there are many sub-wallets that need to be consolidated, considering the fluctuation of the mainnet Gas fee, in order to prevent this from causing the consolidation to fail, multiple signatures may be required to complete the consolidation task.
- For security reasons, manual consolidation needs to be signed by the consolidation wallet to ensure the credibility of the executed contract consolidation operation.
- During the manual consolidation process, you need to pay the corresponding Gas fee.

</Warning>

### Automatic Consolidation

ChainUp's contract consolidation supports automatic consolidation, which can be compatible with all MPC merchants that have opened and not opened the API.

If you need to turn on the automatic consolidation feature of contract consolidation, please contact the customer service team in time. They will provide you with detailed guidance and support to ensure your automatic consolidation service goes smoothly.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Precautions**

- Automatic consolidation requires you to be responsible for publishing contracts, authorizing sub-wallets, and the Gas fee required for automatic consolidation.

Ensure that you have completed these necessary preparations before launching the automatic consolidation service.
