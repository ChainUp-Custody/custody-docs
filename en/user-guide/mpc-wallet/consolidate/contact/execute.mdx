<Note>
Please note that only authorized sub-wallets and tokens can execute auto sweeping operations.
</Note>

## I. Function Introduction
The Sweep ERC-20 Tokens feature of ChainUp Custody refers to the creation of smart contracts to **sweep** digital assets scattered across different wallets into a specific wallet address. By consolidating small assets, it can significantly reduce the overall transaction costs, improve user transfer experience, and reduce the complexity of managing custody funds.

This document will introduce how to sweep ERC-20 tokens, in order to orderly sweep assets scattered in different wallets to the designated wallet address. Before performing the following steps, please ensure that you have fully configured the auto sweeping rules and completed the corresponding authorization work.

Assuming your wallet assets have reached the sweeping threshold, you can consolidate the assets to the set wallet address in two ways:

**Manual Sweeping** or **Automatic Sweeping**.

## II. Operation Procedure

### Manual Sweeping

Through the Custody APP, you can manually sweep ERC-20 tokens according to your needs. This method provides the flexibility of user active control.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Precautions**

- If there are many sub-wallets that need to be consolidated, considering the fluctuation of the mainnet Gas fee, in order to prevent this from causing the sweeping orders to fail, multiple signatures may be required to complete the auto sweeping operation.
- For security reasons, manual sweeping operation needs to be signed by the wallet's private key to ensure the credibility of the executed contract consolidation operation.
- During the manual sweeping process, you need to pay the corresponding miners fee.

</Warning>

### Automatic Sweeping

The Sweep ERC-20 Tokens Feature supports automatic consolidation, which can be compatible with all MPC Wallet clients, irrespective of whether they have activated the API or not..

If you need to turn on the automatic sweeping feature for ERC-20 tokens, please contact the customer service team in time. They will provide you with detailed guidance and support to ensure your automatic sweeping operation goes smoothly.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Precautions**

- Automatic sweeping requires you to be responsible for publishing contracts, authorizing sub-wallets, and the Gas fee required for automatic sweeping.

Ensure that you have completed these necessary preparations before launching the automatic sweeping service.
