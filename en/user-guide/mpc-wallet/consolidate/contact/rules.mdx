title: Configuring Auto Sweeping Rules
---

## I. Function Introduction

By creating smart contracts and auto sweeping rules through the Custody Web interface, you can ensure that the system will operate according to predefined rules during consolidation. Simultaneously, you can also authorize sweeping contract for sub-wallets in the App, thus accurately determining which sub-wallets have the right to sweep assets.

<Warning>
**Important Tips**

- The ChainUp Custody platform only supports `Web3 sub-wallets` for Sweep ERC-20 Tokens feature.
- Each sub-wallet and token that needs to be swept must be authorized in advance.
- It is strongly recommended not to configure the same asset strategy for both the Sweep ERC-20 Tokens feature and the Sweep All Coins feature simultaneously. If an error occurs, the system will execute the sweeping operation configured earliest based on the time of your operation.

</Warning>
