title: Configuring Auto Sweeping Rules
---

##  Function Introduction

By creating smart contracts and auto sweeping rules through the CryptSafe Web interface, you can ensure that the system will operate according to predefined rules during sweeping operation. Simultaneously, you can also authorize sweeping contract for wallets in the App, thus accurately determining which wallets have the right to sweep assets.

<Warning>
**Important Tips**

- The CryptSafe platform only supports `Web3 wallets` for Sweep ERC-20 Tokens feature.
- Each wallet and token that needs to be swept must be authorized in advance.
- It is strongly recommended not to configure the same asset strategy for both the Sweep ERC-20 Tokens feature and the Sweep All Coins feature simultaneously. If an error occurs, the system will execute the sweeping operation configured earliest based on the time of your operation.

</Warning>
