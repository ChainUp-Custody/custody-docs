title: Configuring Contract Consolidation Rules
---

## I. Function Introduction

By creating smart contracts and configuring consolidation rules through the Custody Web interface, you can ensure that the system will operate according to predefined rules during consolidation. Simultaneously, you can also authorize contract consolidation for sub-wallets in the App, thus accurately determining which sub-wallets have the right to consolidate.

<Warning>
**Important Tips**

- The ChainUp Custody platform only supports `Web3 sub-wallets` for contract consolidation.
- Each sub-wallet and token that needs to be consolidated must be authorized in advance.
- It is strongly recommended not to configure contract consolidation strategy and Co-signer consolidation strategy for the same asset at the same time. If you do so, the system will execute the consolidation strategy that was configured first based on your strategy configuration time.

</Warning>
