title: Apply KYT Service

##  Function Introduction

After completing the KYT (Know Your Transaction) configuration, the system will automatically process transaction orders that match the KYT rules based on your settings. You can view the transaction results through the KYT service. If certain transactions require manual approval, you can go to the task list to view and handle the relevant KYT tasks.

<Warning>
1.The system cannot actually prevent high-risk deposit funds from being broadcasted and recorded on the blockchain at the blockchain level. The platform will fulfill its notification obligations and require clients to understand and take appropriate actions based on the specific risk information provided by the KYT service provider.

2.Please ensure that KYT manual reviews are completed in a timely manner. If there are any pending KYT review tasks for a wallet, the transaction activities of that wallet will be restricted.
</Warning>

You can view the KYT to-do items that need to be handled in To-Do.

</Step>

<Step title="KYT Status">

KYT（Know Your Transaction）includes the following stauts：

**KYT Verification in Progress:**

* Verification in Progress: Your business has created a KYT order and submitted it to the KYT service provider, and it is currently being verified. You need to wait for the service provider to return the verification result.


* Verification Timeout: The KYT verification submitted by your business has timed out, and the system will generate a KYT verification timeout task.

**KYT Manual Processing:**

* If your transaction order times out, or if the KYT risk level of the transaction order requires manual review, any member of the wallet can process the KYT result for that transaction. If your configured payment handling method is 'manual processing,' and no action is taken, assets corresponding to the pending KYT processing will not be transferable or swept.

**KYT Manual Review：**

* If your transaction order times out, or if the KYT risk level of the transaction order requires manual review, any member of the wallet can process the KYT result for that transaction. If the configured payment processing method is "Manual Review" and no action is taken, to ensure the safety of funds, any asset addresses awaiting KYT processing will not be allowed to transfer or sweep.
**Deposit Transaction Review Operation**

* Allow Deposit: The transaction amount will be accounted as an asset change, and the payment transaction status will be marked as successful, allowing for collection and transfer operations.

* Return Fund: Initiate a refund request, where the user can select the return address and amount. Once the refund is successful, the status will be updated to "Refunded."

**Transfer Transaction Review Actions**

**Reject Transfer：**

* If the transfer order's KYT risk level policy is set to "Reject Transfer," the system will automatically terminate the transfer order process when the order matches this risk level.

**Allow Transfer: **

* If the transfer order's KYT risk level policy is set to "Allow Transfer," the order will automatically proceed to the next stage when it matches this risk level.

**Manual Review：**

* If the transfer order's KYT risk level policy is set to "Manual Review," the wallet member will decide whether to allow the transfer when the order matches this risk level.

<warning>
**Note:** In the KYT Verification status, you can choose to continue verification or confirm pass. Choosing to continue verification will continue to wait for the KYT service provider's verification result, and choosing to confirm pass allows you to query the processing result yourself and choose the corresponding result. This time will not wait for the KYT service provider to return the result.
