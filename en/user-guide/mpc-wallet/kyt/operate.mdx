title: Apply KYT Service

##  Function Introduction

After completing the KYT (Know Your Transaction) configuration, the system will automatically process transaction orders that match the KYT rules based on your settings. You can view the transaction results through the KYT service. If certain transactions require manual approval, you can go to the task list to view and handle the relevant KYT tasks.

<Warning>
1.The system cannot actually prevent high-risk deposit funds from being broadcasted and recorded on the blockchain at the blockchain level. The platform will fulfill its notification obligations and require clients to understand and take appropriate actions based on the specific risk information provided by the KYT service provider.

2.Please ensure that KYT manual reviews are completed in a timely manner. If there are any pending KYT review tasks for a wallet, the transaction activities of that wallet will be restricted.
</Warning>

<Step title="KYT Status">

KYT (Know Your Transaction) includes the following statuses:

**KYT Verification in Progress:**

* Verification in Progress: Your business has created a KYT order and submitted it to the KYT service provider, and it is currently being verified. You need to wait for the service provider to return the verification result.


* Verification Timeout: The KYT verification submitted by your business has timed out, and the system will generate a KYT verification timeout task.


**KYT Manual Processing:**

* If your configured receipt processing method is 'Manual Processing,' and the deposit order reaches your configured alert level, the order status will be KYT Manual Processing. You need to confirm and handle this task in the to-do list. If not handled, to ensure fund security, this token in the wallet will be intercepted from withdrawal and collection.

**KYT Rejection:**

* If your configured withdrawal processing method is 'Reject Withdrawal,' and the withdrawal order reaches your configured alert level, the order will be directly rejected. This status is the final state of the order.

<warning>
**Note:** In the KYT Verification status, you can choose to continue verification or confirm pass. Choosing to continue verification will continue to wait for the KYT service provider's verification result, and choosing to confirm pass allows you to query the processing result yourself and choose the corresponding result. This time will not wait for the KYT service provider to return the result.

##  Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How does KYT service handle risky transactions?">

The KYT service will alert you to risky transactions and handle them according to your configuration. For example, if your configured receipt processing method is 'Manual Processing,' when a deposit order reaches the alert level you set, the order status will be shown as 'KYT Manual Processing.' You need to confirm and handle this pending task. If the task is not handled, to ensure fund security, the tokens associated with the unprocessed tasks will be unable to be transferred or swept.
