KYT (Know Your Transaction) is a financial regulation and compliance practice designed to help financial institutions and other organizations identify and monitor suspicious transactions related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. By monitoring transaction data in real-time or near real-time, KYT aims to identify abnormal or suspicious transaction behavior to ensure the compliance of the financial system.

<warning>
**Note:** KYT includes the following states:
1. KYT Verification: This state includes two different situations:
    - Your business has already created a KYT order and submitted it to the KYT service provider for verification, at this time you just need to wait for the KYT service provider to return the verification result;
    - Your business has submitted the KYT service provider for verification, but the KYT service verification has timed out, at this time a KYT verification timeout to-do will be generated for you;
2. KYT Manual Processing: If your configured receipt processing method is "Manual Processing", at this time the deposit order reaches your configured alarm level, the order status is KYT manual processing, and you need to confirm the processing of this to-do. If this to-do is not processed, to ensure the safety of funds, the coin of this wallet will be blocked from withdrawal and auto sweeping.
3. KYT Rejection: If your configured withdrawal processing method is "Refuse Withdrawal", at this time the withdrawal order reaches your configured alarm level, then the order will be directly refused to withdraw, and this status is the final state of the order;
</warning>

### Enable the circuit breaker mechanism.
If you wish to enhance KYT risk transaction management, you may enable the circuit breaker mechanism.


The circuit breaker mechanism is a global risk management function that takes precedence over alert-level processing. When enabled, transaction orders will be handled according to the circuit breaker mechanism before any other processes are applied.
- The first transaction's alert level is [Severe]
- The second transaction's alert level is [Low]
- The third transaction's alert level is [Unknown]
At this stage, the user's address activates the circuit breaker mechanism, requiring all three transactions to undergo review in accordance with the circuit breaker's protocols. Once the [Severe] level transaction is processed and the circuit breaker is lifted, the second and third transactions will proceed based on their respective alert levels.
