#### Handling Operational To-Do
The type of to-do items you can operate depends on your account role in the selected workspace.

**Approval members** can approve transactions, agree or refuse transactions, confirm or cancel collection and gas station configuration.

**Workspace owners and admins** can cancel transactions, sign transactions, accelerate transactions, etc.

**Admins** can also receive equal-rights private keys in this module.



<Warning>
Please note the following two points:
1. When operating on the MPC system platform, transaction approval needs to go through GA verification.
2. For any operation that requires a private key signature, you can use the CryptSafe App with locally backed up private keys to scan the QR code.
</Warning>



### Workflow: Done

#### Viewing Done Information

You can enter the "Workflow" page in the App or Web system, select the "Done" module, and view the task records you have processed in the past.

</div>

<Tip>
For transaction-type done tasks, such as transaction approvals and signatures you have processed, you can click on "Done" to view the latest status of the corresponding transaction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How can I view the workflow of other workspaces?">
You can click the MPC button at the top of the page, or click the workspace switch button on the left. After switching to other workspaces, you can enter the operational to-do module of that workspace to view.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="As a admin, can I recover and backup the private key myself?">
Admin cannot recover the private key. You need to contact the workspace owner to resend the private key.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Why can't I complete the tasks waiting for signature and acceleration by scanning the QR code of the to-do item?">
Please confirm the following points:
1. You are the owner of the workspace;
2. The device you are using has backed up the local private key;
3. The QR code has not expired.

If you still cannot perform the scanning operation, please contact online customer service for help.
