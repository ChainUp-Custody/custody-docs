The transaction will follow the current [wallet transfer strategy](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/strategy/approval-flow2) and enter the corresponding approval flow. The designated approvers can either approve or reject the transaction order.

If the transfer information triggers any rejection conditions within the wallet stretegy, the order cannot be created.

<Step title="Wait for Signature and Transaction Confirmation">
    After the signature is successful, you need to wait for the blockchain to process. If the processing time is too long, you can speed up the transaction by increasing the miner's fee for the order.
    
    Once the blockchain confirms, the transaction is complete. You can view the transaction details in the transaction record.
