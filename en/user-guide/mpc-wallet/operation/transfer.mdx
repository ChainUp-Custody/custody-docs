##  Function Introduction

In the ChainUp Custody system, you can perform transfer operations between wallets.

To ensure fund security and efficient approval, we recommend adding a transfer strategy for valuable currencies or NFTs. The transfer process may differ according to different roles.

##  Operation Procedure

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter the Transfer Page">
    In the **APP**, Tokens support quick transfers by swiping left, or you can click to enter the currency details for transfer. NFTs only support transfers after clicking to enter details.

<Step title="Fill in and Confirm Transfer Information">
    We support transfers to other backed-up wallets. To ensure the accuracy of the miner's fee, the fee will be set at the time of signing.
    
    **Ordinary members** can only initiate transfers

    **Approving members** can initiate and approve transfer orders.

    When the order meets the approval rules, the **Workspace creator or Administrator** can proceed to the next step, i.e., signing.
</Step>


<Step title="Workspace creator or Administrator Confirms and Signs">
    The workspace creator or administrator needs to set the miner's fee (some main chains support custom miner fees, you can appropriately increase the miner's fee to speed up transaction processing), confirm the transaction information, and sign.

</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Signature and Transaction Confirmation">
    After the signature is successful, you need to wait for the blockchain to process. If the processing time is too long, you can speed up the transaction by increasing the miner's fee for the order.
    
    Once the blockchain confirms, the transaction is complete. You can view the transaction details in the transaction record.

##  Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Can an Unbacked Workspace Initiate Transfers?">
No, for asset security reasons, you need to complete a private key backup before initiating transfers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="If the miner's fee I set is insufficient, can I increase it during the transaction?">
If the transaction processing time is too long, you can try to speed up the transaction by increasing the miner's fee for the order. But please note that once the transaction has been confirmed by the blockchain, the miner's fee cannot be changed.
