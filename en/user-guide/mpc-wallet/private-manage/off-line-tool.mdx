title: Offline Private Key Recovery
---

##  Function Introduction

As a decentralized enterprise-level wallet, ChainUp Custody does not store customers' private keys. If you need to recover the private keys you created in your MPC Workspace, you can download and use ChainUp Custody's offline private key recovery tool. By using this tool in an offline environment, you can recover the complete private keys of all MPC Workspaces. Once the private key recovery is successful, you can import it into other hardware or software wallets, fully controlling your digital assets.

##  Operation Procedure

### Preparation Stage

<Steps>
<Step title="Obtain all recovery phrases for private key shares in the APP">
In the **Security** feature of your APP, select 【Private Key Management】, and obtain the recovery phrases for the private key shares of your MPC Workspace through 【View Recovery Phrase】.

<Note>
* Only the workspace owner and admin can request to view the recovery phrases of the private key shards.

* Users can request to view the recovery phrases for the following purposes:

1. Manually back up private key shards;
2. Recover the complete workspace private key using an offline private key recovery tool.

Please note that requesting to view the mnemonic phrases requires approval according to the workstation's policies. Once approved, you will have 24 hours to view the information.
