title: Private Key Backup
---

## I. Function Introduction

The MPC wallet consists of **three private key shares**. Two of these shares are encrypted and stored with **Microsoft Cloud Services** and **Amazon Cloud Services**, while the other is kept on your **local device**. To ensure the security of your assets, it is vital to promptly backup the locally stored private key share and keep it safe. These private key shares exist in the form of a **recovery phrase**, making them easy to remember.

There are two backup options for private key shares: **local backup** and **cloud backup**.

<Warning>
To ensure the security of your assets, please make sure to backup your private key shares promptly. Functions of wallets that are not backed up will be restricted.
</Warning>
