title: Private Key Recovery

##  Function Introduction

The CryptSafe MPC Workspace is designed to protect user privacy and security by employing multiple private key shares. These shares are dispersed across multiple devices through key sharing, enhancing the workspace's security. The private key recovery feature plays a crucial role in the MPC Workspace, allowing users to recover their workspace in case of device loss or damage.

<Note>
For asset security, private key shares are strongly tied to the account. This means that the loss of both your private key shares and the account could impact your assets.
</Note>

Private key recovery supports two methods: **manual recovery** and **cloud recovery**.
