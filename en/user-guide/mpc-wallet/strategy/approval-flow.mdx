title: Custom Strategy Engine
---

##  Function Introduction

ChainUp Custody's strategy engine provides a powerful tool for customizing transaction rules for your MPC wallet, enabling precise management and control over outgoing transactions. This flexible system allows you to define a series of transaction rules based on your individual needs, ensuring the security and efficient circulation of assets. These rules can control the approval process for specific asset transfers and specify users who can approve transactions.

ChainUp Custody's strategy engine will automatically apply your defined transfer strategy to all transfer transactions manually created through the Web or App. Once a member initiates a transfer request, the relevant transfer strategy will be followed by the approver according to the rules you set:

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Points to Note**

We emphasize the importance of correctly implementing transfer strategies. Your transfer strategy is a key layer of asset protection, so please customize it according to your business needs.

Transactions initiated by the administrator (wallet creator) of the MPC wallet are not subject to transfer strategy management.

Transactions initiated via API are not subject to transfer strategy management.
</Warning>


##  Operation Procedure

### Customize Your Transfer Strategy

<Steps>
<Step title="Log in and Open Transfer Strategy">
    Log into the Custody APP's MPC wallet, open 【Security】-【Transfer Strategy】 feature.

        </CardGroup>
</div>

</Step>
<Step title="Add and Configure Transfer Strategy">
In this step, you can define the following parameters of the transfer strategy:

1. **Strategy Name**: Name your strategy for easy future search and management.
2. **Approving Members and Approval Threshold**: Select team members of the sub-wallet as approving members and set an approval threshold.
3. **Coin for Approval**: Select the coin to be approved for transfer.

</div>


<Warning>
**Key Steps and Points to Note**

An MPC sub-wallet can create multiple transfer strategies, but each asset's transfer strategy must be unique.

If an asset has never edited its transfer strategy, then the asset's transactions default to requiring only the wallet administrator's final signature confirmation.
</Warning>

</Step>

</Steps>

### Approval Process Example

<Tip>
You can quickly view [To-Do details](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/operation/to-do) or [Transaction details](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/operation/transfer) to efficiently understand the progress of approval.
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter the Transfer Page">
    In the **APP**, Tokens support quick transfers by swiping left, or you can click to enter the coin details for transfer. NFTs only support transfers after clicking to enter details.
<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
    <img src="/images/user-guide/transfer1.jpg" width="200"/>
   <img src="/images/user-guide/transfer2.jpg" width="200"/>
    </CardGroup>
</div>

    On the **Web Page**, you can select the sub-wallet for transfer.
    <div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <img src="/images/user-guide/transfer4.jpg" />
</div>

</Step>
<Step title="Fill in and Confirm Transfer Information">
    We support transfers to other backed-up sub-wallets. To ensure the accuracy of the miner's fee, the fee will be set at the time of signing.
    
    **Ordinary members** can only initiate transfers
    <div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
    <img src="/images/user-guide/transfer3.jpg" width="200"/>
    <img src="/images/user-guide/transfer6.jpg" width="200"/>
    </CardGroup>
</div>
    
    **Approving members** can initiate and approve transfer orders.
 <div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <CardGroup cols={3}>
    <img src="/images/user-guide/transfer5.png" width="200"/>
    <img src="/images/user-guide/transfer7.png" width="200"/>
 <img src="/images/user-guide/transfer8.png" width="200"/>
    </CardGroup>
</div>

    When the order meets the approval rules, the **wallet creator** can proceed to the next step, i.e., signing.
</Step>


<Step title="Wallet Creator Confirms and Signs">
    The wallet creator needs to set the miner's fee (some main chains support custom miner fees, you can appropriately increase the miner's fee to speed up transaction processing), confirm the transaction information, and sign.

    </CardGroup>
</div>

</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Signature and Transaction Confirmation">
    After the signature is successful, you need to wait for the blockchain to process. If the processing time is too long, you can speed up the transaction by increasing the miner's fee for the order.
    
    Once the blockchain confirms, the transaction is complete. You can view the transaction details in the transaction record.
