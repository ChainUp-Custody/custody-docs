**Critical Steps and Considerations**
The default basic strategy for all MPC wallets requires owner approval. Users can add other wallet members for joint approval according to the organization's equity requirements.

As the last line of defense for wallet security, the basic strategy cannot be deleted. Once modified, changes to the basic strategy will be applied to all risk control scenarios.

Each wallet can only have one basic strategy, which can be modified but not added or deleted.

We emphasize the importance of correctly configuring the basic strategy. As it is the last line of defense in all risk control scenarios in the wallet, carefully select your basic strategy approvers and avoid frequent modifications.
