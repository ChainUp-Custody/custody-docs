## Function Introduction

ChainUp Custody's strategy engine provides a powerful transaction rule customization function for your MPC system, used for precise management and control of outgoing transactions. This flexible system allows you to define a series of transaction rules according to personalized needs, ensuring the security and effective circulation of assets. These rules can control the transfer approval process of specific assets and clarify the users who can approve transactions.

ChainUp Custody's strategy engine will automatically apply your defined transfer strategy to all transfer transactions manually created through the Web or App. Once a member initiates a transfer request, the relevant transfer strategy will be acted upon by the approver according to the rules you set:

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Points to Note**

We emphasize the importance of correctly implementing transfer policies. Your transfer strategy is a key layer of asset protection; please customize it according to your business needs.

Transactions initiated by the MPC workspace creator are not managed by the transfer strategy.

Transactions initiated via API are not managed by the transfer strategy.
</Warning>

</div>

</Step>
<Step title="Add and Configure Transfer Strategy">
In this step, you can define the following parameters of the transfer strategy:

1. **Strategy Name**: Name your strategy for easy search and management in the future.
2. **Approvers and Approval Threshold**: Select the wallet's team members as approval members and set the approval threshold.
3. **Coin for Approval**: Choose the transfer coin that needs approval.

</div>

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Points to Note**

A wallet can create multiple transfer policies, but each asset's transfer Strategy must be unique.

If an asset has never edited a transfer Strategy, the asset's transaction defaults to requiring the workspace creator for the final signature confirmation.

### Approval Process Example

<Tip>
You can efficiently and conveniently understand the current approval progress by viewing the [details of the workflow](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/operation/to-do) or [details of the transaction information](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/operation/transfer).
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Initiate Transfer">
Whether it's a ordinary member, approval member, or workspace creator, they can initiate a transfer by logging into the Custody APP or PC version.

You need to select the wallet and coin for the transfer, enter the address, quantity, and remarks after confirming the transfer, and then wait for approval.

In the **APP**, Tokens support quick transfer by swiping left, or you can click to enter the token details for transfer. NFT only supports clicking to enter details for transfer.

<Step title="Fill in and Confirm Transfer Information">
  **Ordinary members** can only initiate transfers

    </CardGroup>
</div>

</Step>

<Step title="Approval Members Approve">

The approval members of this transfer Strategy will receive approval prompts in "To Do". Approval members can perform approval operations.

If the member initiating the transfer is an approval member, then the approval member's approval status is defaulted as passed.

When the order meets the approval rules, it requires the workspace creator or admin to handle the authorization signature.

    </CardGroup>
</div>

<Tip>
**Agree to the transaction:** When the transaction reaches the approval threshold, it is automatically submitted to the workspace creator or workspace admin for signature confirmation, then broadcast to the blockchain.

**Reject the transaction:** When the transaction does not reach the approval threshold, it is automatically terminated to ensure unauthorized transactions are stopped.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Transaction Signature">
The workspace creator can give the final approval to the transfer request. If they disagree with the transfer request, they can directly cancel the transaction; if they agree with the transfer request, they can perform a signature operation.
