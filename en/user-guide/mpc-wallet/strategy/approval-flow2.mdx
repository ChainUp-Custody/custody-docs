title: Configure Advanced Strategy
---

## Introduction

The strategy engine of ChainUp Custody provides robust support for your MPC system. Users can set advanced strategies to manage wallets, with these advanced strategies taking precedence over basic strategy, aimed at controlling transaction risk scenarios. Users can easily configure user roles, control actions, and approval workflows for each wallet. Once a transaction strategy is formulated, any transfer or operation will not be executed without approval.




<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

The application scope of basic strategy is for transfers.

The priority of advanced strategies can be adjusted, and orders will hit the highest priority strategy first.

**If you choose to edit Advanced Strategy - Transfer Transactions, you can configure the following parameters:

**Strategy Trigger Conditions:**

* Transfer asset type

* Transfer initiator

* Transfer limit: The amount of the transaction in cryptocurrency or its value in USD



**If you choose to edit Advanced Strategy - Web3 Transactions, you can configure the following parameters:

** Strategy Trigger Conditions: **

* Initiator

* Contract Address: Controls the contract transaction address that needs interaction



**All types of advanced strategies have the same trigger action editing capabilitiesï¼š**


**Strategy Trigger Actions:**

**Option 1: Orders hitting the strategy require approval**

You can create a multi-level approval process, consisting of regular approval nodes and approval and signing nodes:

Regular approval nodes can include all wallet members as approvers, with a maximum of 9 levels,

The approval and signing node is the final node and can include members with wallet private key permissions or add a co-signer as an approver for automated approval.

**Critical Steps and Considerations**

If users want to add, modify, or delete advanced strategies, they need approval from the basic strategy for the changes to take effect.

If a wallet has never had advanced strategies edited, all its risk control scenarios are governed by the basic strategy. Learn how to [configure basic strategy](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/strategy/approval-flow).

<Step title="Confirm Advanced Policy Modifications">
    Any additions, deletions, or modifications to Advanced Strategies require approval from the current basic strategy to take effect. If you are an approver of the currently effective basic strategy, you can find the corresponding pending tasks in [Workflow] to process them.
