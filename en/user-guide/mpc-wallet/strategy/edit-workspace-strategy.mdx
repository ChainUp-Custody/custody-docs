title: Configure Workspace Strategy
---


##  I. Function Introduction

Utilize the ChainUp Strategy Engine to configure risk management strategies for your workspace. Once configured, any core operations, such as viewing recovery phrases and managing APIs, require approval from designated approvers to execute.

This feature not only protects your business from internal collusion but also streamlines operational processes. Users can customize workspace strategies based on organizational structure and business workflows to achieve effective internal control and collaborative management.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Considerations**

The control scenarios covered by current workspace strategies include: API management, viewing recovery phrases, and workspace policy editing. The system automatically assigns default workspace policies to all new workspaces, with creators initially designated as approvers for workspace policies.

Only workspace members, such as workspace creators and administrators, have permission to edit workspace policies.
