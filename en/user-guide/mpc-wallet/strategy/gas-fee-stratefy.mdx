title: Miner (Gas) Fee Policy
---

## I. Function Introduction

ChainUp Custody's strategy engine will automatically apply your defined miner fee policy to all types of transactions. When these transactions require manual setting of miner fees, it will control according to the policy, preventing the manual entry of excessively high transaction miner fees.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Points to Note**

We emphasize the importance of correctly implementing transfer policies. Your transfer policy is a key layer of asset protection; please customize it according to your business needs.

If you enable the miner fee policy, all asset transactions, including transactions initiated via API and those initiated by the creator, will be controlled by the miner fee policy.

## II. Management Scenarios
Management of transaction types: Covers all transactions, including manual withdrawals (transfers) and API withdrawals.

Management of transaction range: Includes all asset transactions, whether they are cryptocurrencies or NFTs.
