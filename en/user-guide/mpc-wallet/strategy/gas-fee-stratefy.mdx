title: Miner (Gas) Fee Policy
---

## I. Function Introduction

ChainUp Custody's strategy engine provides a miner fee policy for your MPC system to prevent private key holders from setting excessively high custom miner fees due to malicious actions or errors, leading to financial loss.

ChainUp Custody's strategy engine will automatically apply your defined miner fee policy to all types of transactions. When these transactions require manual setting of miner fees, it will control according to the policy, preventing the manual entry of excessively high transaction miner fees.

<Warning>
**Key Steps and Points to Note**

We emphasize the importance of correctly implementing transfer policies. Your transfer policy is a key layer of asset protection; please customize it according to your business needs.

If you enable the miner fee policy, all asset transactions, including transactions initiated via API and those initiated by the creator, will be controlled by the miner fee policy.

## II. Management Scenarios
