title: Signature Protection

## Function Introduction

Welcome to using ChainUp Custody. We provide a robust signature protection feature for your MPC system, aiming to effectively control the transaction behaviors of users with equal-weight private keys (such as workspace admins).

By enabling this feature, the transaction signature operations of other private key holders, apart from the workspace creator, will be strictly controlled.


## II. Control Scenarios
**Transactions without approval flow**: Non-creator private key holders will not be able to independently initiate and sign **transactions without an approval process**.
**Transactions with approval flow**: For transactions that already have an approval process, other private key holders will not be able to sign **transactions initiated and approved by themselves**.

The main advantage of this strategy is to enhance internal control and effectively prevent potential risky behaviors. ChainUp Custody is committed to providing a safe and reliable management solution for your digital assets, letting you focus on your business development with peace of mind.
