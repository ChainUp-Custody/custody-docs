title: Signature Protection

## Function Introduction

Welcome to using Keysecure. We provide a robust signature protection feature for your MPC system, aiming to effectively control the transaction behaviors of users with equal-weight private keys (such as admins).

By enabling this feature, the transaction signature operations of other private key holders, apart from the workspace owner, will be strictly controlled.


## Control Scenarios

**Transfer Transactions**

Once this feature is enabled, holders of the same authority private keys (Admins) cannot approve or sign transaction orders they initiate.

The main advantage of this policy is to enhance internal controls, effectively prevent potential risk behaviors, and avoid self-approval and self-signing by administrators. Keysecure is committed to providing a secure and reliable management solution for your digital assets, allowing you to focus on business development with peace of mind.
