title: Add New MPC Wallet Member
---

##  Function Introduction

<Note>Only the wallet private key holder can add/delete wallet members.</Note>
In the MPC wallet, you can add new users and assign them different roles. The system currently has three types of roles:

- **Admin**: The member who created the wallet is the default wallet admin, possessing all wallet permissions.
- **Approval Member**: After the admin adds ordinary members to the approval strategy, they automatically become approval members, possessing permissions such as initiating receipts, transfers, approvals, etc.
- **Ordinary Member**: The members added to the wallet by the admin are default ordinary members; they have basic permissions such as initiating receipts and transfers.

You can refer to the [MPC User Role Introduction](/help-center/manage-mpc/user-setting/user-role) for specific member role descriptions.

<Tip>
**To become an MPC wallet member, you must meet the following conditions:**
1. Have a ChainUp Custody account
2. Complete KYC verification
3. Bind and enable Google Authenticator
