title: Adding New MPC Workspace Users
---

## Function Introduction

<Note>
Only the workspace creator can add/delete workspace members.
</Note>

In the MPC workspace, you can add new users and assign them different roles. The system currently has three types of roles:
- **Workspace Creator**: The member who creates the workspace defaults as the creator (Owner), with the highest authority;
- **Workspace Administrator**: The creator can add members from the contact list to the workspace and assign them as workspace administrators. Administrators have the authority to initiate receipts, transfers for all wallets under the workspace, and will have the workspace co-privilege private key to sign and accelerate transfer transactions;
<Tip> 
Currently, workspace administrators temporarily cannot sign for private key operation behaviors other than manual transfer signatures and accelerations.
</Tip>
- **Ordinary Members**: Members added to the wallet by the creator default as ordinary members; they have basic permissions such as initiating receipts, transfers;

For specific member role descriptions, you can refer to [MPC User Role Introduction](/help-center/manage-mpc/user-setting/user-role)

<Tip>
**To become an MPC workspace member, you must meet the following requirements:**
1. Have a ChainUp Custody account
2. Complete KYC authentication
3. Bind and activate Google Authenticator

<Step title="Assigning Roles to New Members">
    You can assign one type of authority to users: 1. Workspace role 2. Wallet role
    
    If you choose the workspace role, you can assign them as workspace administrators, which will require you to send a co-privilege private key to them.

    If you choose the wallet role, you can assign them as ordinary members of a specific wallet.

## III. Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How can I change a user's role?">
The creator can view the user's permission details in the workspace members and modify the user's role. Please note, if the member is part of an approval flow of a certain wallet, they will automatically have co-management authority of that wallet and it cannot be canceled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I add users if I am not the workspace creator?">
Sorry, only the workspace creator can add users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any role restrictions in the workspace?">
The total number of members in your workspace is limited to the service package you purchased, but there are no restrictions on specific roles.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does a workspace administrator manage their private key?">
The current system does not support the workspace administrator to back up and restore their private key. If the private key fragment is lost due to reasons such as changing devices, please contact the workspace creator to resend it (Select the corresponding workspace in "Workspace Members", check your specific permissions to operate).
