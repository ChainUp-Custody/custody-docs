title: Becoming a Admin
---

## I. Function Introduction

<Note>Only the owner of the workspace can add/delete workspace members.</Note>
When the owner of the workspace adds you to the workspace and assigns you as the admin, you will receive the co-privilege private key of the workspace while gaining access to all the wallets of the workspace.

<Tip> 
Once you become the admin, you can access all wallets under the workspace, and have basic permissions such as initiating receipts, transfers, as well as the authority to sign transaction orders.

Currently, admins temporarily cannot sign for private key operation behaviors other than manual transfer signatures and accelerations.

For specific member role descriptions, you can refer to [MPC User Roles](/help-center/manage-mpc/user-setting/user-role)

## III. Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="What situations might prevent me from receiving the private key?">
The following situations might cause failure in receiving the private key:

Loss of historical RSA public-private key pair: If your historical RSA public-private key pair is lost, decrypting the admin's private key will fail. Please try to log into the App again and contact the owner to resend the relevant private key.

Network anomalies: Connection issues or network anomalies may lead to failure in private key transmission. Please ensure your network connection is stable and try again.

The owner has revoked your admin privileges: If the owner has revoked your admin privileges, you will not be able to receive the private key. In this case, it is recommended to contact the owner to understand the details and resolve the issue.

Please note, these are just some of the possible causes. The specific situation may need to be confirmed and resolved through further communication with the workspace owner.
