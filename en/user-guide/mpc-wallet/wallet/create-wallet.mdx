title: Creating an MPC Wallet

##  Function Introduction

MPC wallets are divided into two types: **main wallets** and **sub-wallets**. A main wallet can create multiple sub-wallets to meet different business needs.

### Application Scenarios

1. The main wallet can be used for asset statistics of a certain business line;

Sub-wallets can be allocated to different users for tracking and managing each user's assets.

2. The main wallet can be used for the company's total asset statistics;

Sub-wallets can be allocated to different business departments for tracking and managing each department's assets.

##  Operation Procedure

### Creating a Main Wallet

After logging in to the Custody App and switching to the MPC system, you can create an MPC main wallet according to your business needs.

If the default wallet configuration does not meet your needs, you can contact the business manager or send an email to custody@chainup.com for support.
