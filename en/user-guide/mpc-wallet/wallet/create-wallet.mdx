title: Creating MPC Workspace
---

## I. Function Introduction

The MPC system is divided into two types: **Workspace** and **Wallet**. A workspace can create multiple wallets to meet diverse business requirements.

### Application Scenarios

1. Workspace can be used for asset statistics for a particular business line;

Wallets can be allocated to different users for tracking and managing each user's assets.

2. Workspace can be used for the company's total asset statistics;

Wallets can be allocated to different business departments for tracking and managing each department's assets.

## II. Operation Procedure

### Creating a Workspace

After logging into the Custody App and switching to the MPC system, you can create an MPC workspace based on your business requirements.
