title: Creating MPC Workspace
---

## I. Function Introduction

An MPC system user can create multiple workstations, and each workspace can create multiple wallets. Each wallet supports multiple asset types, and each asset type can have one or more addresses.

<Tip> 
The number of workspaces and wallets you can create, as well as the range of supported networks, depends on the service package you have purchased. If you have additional needs, please contact the Custody support team for assistance.
</Tip>

### Application Scenarios

**A workspace can be viewed as a group entity**

The Owner can add [Admin](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/wallet/become-admin)，and modify the [workspace strategy](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/strategy/edit-workspace-strategy)according to their needs. For key operation scenarios such as API management and retrieving the workspace's mnemonic, strict risk control through strategies is required to ensure unified and secure management of the group’s operations.



**Wallets under the workspace are akin to different departments of the group, with assets managed independently.**

Wallets are equivalent to the various departments within the group, where each department’s assets are managed independently. The Owner can [add member](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/wallet/add-user) to the wallet，and set [basic strategy](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/strategy/approval-flow2) and [advanced strategy](/user-guide/mpc-wallet/strategy/approval-flow) to ensure the security of fund transfers and efficient internal asset management under control.


## II. Operation Procedure

### Creating a Workspace

After logging into the CryptoSafe App and switching to the MPC system, you can create an MPC workspace based on your business requirements.
<Steps>
<Step title="Naming the Workspace">
Please carefully design the workspace name. To differentiate the purpose of the workspace and facilitate team member management, the workspace name cannot be changed after creation.

<Step title="Entering the Private Key Password">
The private key password is used for the encryption and decryption of private key shards. It is crucial and should be managed carefully.

After you create an MPC workspace, the system will automatically create an associated wallet of the Web3 type.

If the default configuration of the workspace does not meet your needs, you can contact the business manager or send an email to service@cryptsafe.sg for support.
