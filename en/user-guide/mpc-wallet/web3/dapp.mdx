title: Connect to DApp
---

## I. Function Introduction
With the growing demand for Web3 accessibility and use, more and more users want to directly use dApps to manage their NFTs, earn rewards, etc. ChainUp Custody's Web3 wallet connection function allows your users to directly connect their wallet addresses to Web3 applications (dApps) without using any other wallets or any other applications.

<Note> 
Please ensure that you have opened the corresponding main chain's Web3 type sub-wallet, otherwise you will not be able to authorize DApp use.

If your wallet does not support the main chain of Dapp, please contact the customer service team to open it.
</Note>

<Step title="Authorize Sub-Wallet">
<Tip> 
Whether it is authorization or payment, you need to sign, pay Gas fees, and broadcast on-chain.
</Tip>

When trading with non-main chain coins, DApp will initiate an authorization request, and the MPC wallet will pop up the authorization window. You can view the authorization information and edit the total transaction amount limit of the DApp contract;

The main chain coin transaction or already authorized transaction will directly initiate payment, and the MPC wallet will pop up the payment window;
