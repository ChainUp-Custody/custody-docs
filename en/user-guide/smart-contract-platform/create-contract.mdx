title: Creating Warm/Cold Wallet Contracts
---



## Function Overview

On the ChainUp Custody's smart contract platform, you can link third-party wallets and create warm or cold wallet contracts across different networks.



## Operation Process

<Steps>

<Step title="Select Network and Connect Wallet">
Choose the network on which you want to create a contract based on your business needs, and connect your third-party wallet.

<Tip>
1. You may need to install a browser extension for the third-party wallet to invoke the wallet on the Web.
2. Custody supports the following contract networks:
   - Ethereum
   - Binance Smart Chain
   - TRON
   - Huobi ECO Chain
3. Different network contracts support different wallets. For example, creating a TRON contract requires connecting to TronLink or OKX.

</Step>

<Step title="Edit Contract Content">
You can edit the following parameters for the new contract:
1. Contract Name
2. Contract Members: Signer addresses and signer notes for the multisig contract
3. Multisig Threshold: The number of signers required to confirm any contract transaction (including contract configuration modifications)

<Note>
Since any contract signer will default to agree and sign the proposal they initiate, to achieve joint management, add 2 or more signers for each contract and set the multisig threshold to 2 or higher to enhance transaction security.

<Step title="Execute">
After initiating the proposal, wait for the contract creation results.

2. You can view the proposal creation record in the operation logs.
