title: Managing Contract Signers and Multisig Threshold
---


## Function Overview

On the ChainUp Custody's [smart contract platform](http://cold.chainup.com), you can link third-party wallets to add or remove contract members and modify the multisig threshold for your managed contracts.

To ensure contract fund security, Custody recommends adding multiple signers to the contract and setting the multisig threshold to greater than one. This ensures that all contract proposals are approved by multiple signers, preventing accidental operations or internal malicious actions.

<Tip>
1. The initial signers and multisig threshold are configured when creating the contract.
2. Modifying signers and the multisig threshold requires approval and confirmation from the current contract signers. The proposal will only be updated after reaching the current multisig threshold.
3. You can view the proposal creation record in the operation logs.
4. You can view successfully initiated proposals in the [Transaction Records](/user-guide/smart-contract-platform/transactions).
</Tip>



## Modifying Administrators and Multisig Threshold

<Steps>

<Step title="Select Network and Connect Wallet">
Visit [Smart Contract Platform](http://cold.chainup.com), choose the contract network you wish to access based on your business needs, and connect your third-party wallet.

<Tip>
1. You may need to install a browser extension for the third-party wallet to invoke the wallet and access the contract on the Web.
2. Custody supports the following contract networks:
   - Ethereum
   - Binance Smart Chain
   - TRON
   - Huobi ECO Chain
3. Different network contracts support different wallets. For example, accessing TRON contracts requires connecting to TronLink or OKX.
</Tip>




</Step>

<Step title="Select Contract">
View the contract list, select the contract you wish to access, and click to enter the [Member Management] page.

<Tip>
You can only access contract information where the connected wallet address is a signer.

To ensure security, the contract needs to reach a certain number of confirmations before it can be displayed on the platform. If you do not see the contract information, please wait a moment and then refresh the list.

<Warning>
We strongly recommend setting the multi-signature threshold of the contract to greater than 1 to ensure that multiple members jointly sign proposal transactions. This can effectively prevent accidental operations and internal malicious behavior.

To ensure security, the contract must reach a certain number of confirmations before it can be displayed on the platform. If you do not see the contract information, please wait a moment and then refresh the list.
