title: Managing Vote Free Address
---


## Function Overview

On the Keysecure's [smart contract platform](https://cold.keysecure.io), you can link third-party wallets to add or remove transfer-free addresses for your managed contracts.

To enable automated transfers, you may need to add transfer-free addresses to the contract. Transactions initiated by these addresses do not require approval from signers to be successful.

<Tip>
1. Adding a transfer-free address proposal requires approval and confirmation by the contract signers. The proposal will only take effect after reaching the contract's multisig threshold.
2. You can view the proposal creation record in the operation logs.
3. You can view successfully initiated whitelist proposals in the [Transaction Records](/user-guide/smart-contract-platform/transactions).

##  Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="What is Vote-Free Address？">
The vote free address is a tool used for automated fund dispatch, automatically generated and assigned by the Keysecure System. This address will automatically initiate warm-to-hot and warm-to-cold transactions according to the funding dispatch strategy, which will take effect without requiring approval from warm wallet signers.

Please first create a fund flowing strategy for the relevant coin, then obtain the vote free address, and add it to the warm wallet contract on the corresponding network.

If you cannot obtain the vote free address in the MPC wallet, please contact online customer support for assistance.

<Accordion title="How to Manage Vote Free Addresses?">
