title: Managing Vote Free Address
---


## Function Overview

On the ChainUp Custody's smart contract platform, you can link third-party wallets to add or remove transfer-free addresses for your managed contracts.

To enable automated transfers, you may need to add transfer-free addresses to the contract. Transactions initiated by these addresses do not require approval from signers to be successful.

<Tip>
1. Adding a transfer-free address proposal requires approval and confirmation by the contract signers. The proposal will only take effect after reaching the contract's multisig threshold.
2. You can view the proposal creation record in the operation logs.
3. You can view successfully initiated whitelist proposals in the [Transaction Records].
