## Contract Receiving

<Steps>

<Step title="Select Network and Connect Wallet">
Based on your business needs, visit [Smaet Contract Platform](http://cold.chainup.com)ï¼Œchoose the contract network you wish to access and connect your third-party wallet.

<Tip>
1. You may need to install a browser extension for the third-party wallet to invoke the wallet and access the contract on the Web.
2. Custody supports the following contract networks:
   - Ethereum
   - Binance Smart Chain

3. Different network contracts support different wallets. For example, accessing TRON contracts requires connecting to TronLink or OKX.
