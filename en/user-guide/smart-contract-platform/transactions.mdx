## Function Overview

On Keysecure’s [smart contract platform](https://cold.keysecure.io), you can link third-party wallets to view and manage all transaction information of a contract, as well as review and approve pending proposals.


## Operation Process

<Steps>

<Step title="Select Network and Connect Wallet">
Based on your business needs, choose the network where you want to create a contract, and connect your third-party wallet.

<Tip>
1. You may need to install a browser extension for the third-party wallet to invoke the wallet on the Web.
2. Keysecure supports the following contract networks:
   - Ethereum
   - Binance Smart Chain
   - TRON
   - Huobi ECO Chain
3. Different network contracts support different wallets. For example, when creating a TRON contract, you need to connect to TronLink or OKX.

<Step title="View Contract Transactions">

<Step title="Approve Proposal">
Select the type of proposal under [Pending for My Approval], choose the proposal you wish to approve, and proceed with the signature confirmation.

<Note>
Approving and confirming a proposal requires on-chain broadcasting and gas fee confirmation. If you do not wish to approve a proposal, Keysecure currently does not support rejecting proposals—please refrain from taking any action.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Why Can’t I View a Specific Proposal for the Contract?">
Please ensure the following:

1. You are a signer of the contract;
2. The proposal has been successfully created and completed on-chain broadcasting.

If you still cannot view the contract proposal, please contact Keysecure's customer support team for assistance.

<Accordion title="Why does the approval process of ongoing proposals change?">
Ongoing proposals will follow the latest singer and multi-signature threshold requirements. If there are changes to the contract’s signer or multi-signature threshold, the approval process for proposals will automatically update as well.
